abstract = {The international transport, storage and utilisation of LNG is growing rapidly. Whilst the LNG industry has an excellent safety record, the possibility of an accidental release cannot be discounted. Internationally-accepted standards, such as the 59A Standard of the US National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), provide direction on the assessment of LNG spill hazards and hazard range criteria which must be met. Modelling of the atmospheric dispersion of LNG vapour from accidental spills is one of the critical steps in such hazard analyses. This paper describes a comprehensive evaluation protocol devised for the 59A Standard, specifically for the assessment of LNG vapour dispersion models. The evaluation protocol is based on methodologies developed in previous European Union studies, which have been extended, significantly adapted and tailored to the specific requirements of the evaluation of models for the dispersion of LNG vapour. The protocol comprises scientific evaluation of the numerical and physical basis of models for the dispersion of LNG vapour, model verification, and validation; resulting in a comprehensive model evaluation report which includes qualitative and quantitative criteria for model acceptance. A supporting suite of validation data, and guidance on the use of this data, has also been produced. The NFPA 59A (2009) standard states that LNG vapour dispersion models are acceptable for use if they have been evaluated in accordance with this protocol. {\textcopyright} 2012.},

abstract = {In the present paper heavy gas dispersion calculations were performed with OpenFoam. For a wind tunnel test case, numerical data was validated with experiments. For a full scale numerical experiment, a code to code comparison was performed with numerical results obtained from Fluent. The validation was performed in a gravity driven environment (slope), where the heavy gas induced the turbulence. For the code to code comparison, a hypothetical heavy gas release into a strongly turbulent atmospheric boundary layer including terrain effects was selected. The investigations were performed for SF6 and CO2 as heavy gases applying the standard k-e{\{}open{\}} turbulence model. A strong interaction of the heavy gas with the turbulence is present which results in a strong damping of the turbulence and therefore reduced heavy gas mixing. Especially this interaction, based on the buoyancy effects, was studied in order to ensure that the turbulence-buoyancy coupling is the main driver for the reduced mixing and not the global behaviour of the turbulence modelling.For both test cases, comparisons were performed between OpenFoam and Fluent solutions which were mainly in good agreement with each other. Beside steady state solutions, the time accuracy was investigated. In the low turbulence environment (wind tunnel test) which for both codes (laminar solutions) was in good agreement, also with the experimental data. The turbulent solutions of OpenFoam were in much better agreement with the experimental results than the Fluent solutions. Within the strong turbulence environment, both codes showed an excellent comparability. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Accurate Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations of atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) flow are essential for a wide variety of atmospheric studies including pollutant dispersion and deposition. The accuracy of such simulations can be seriously compromised when wall-function roughness modifications based on experimental data for sand-grain roughened pipes and channels are applied at the bottom of the computational domain. This type of roughness modification is currently present in many CFD codes including Fluent 6.2 and Ansys CFX 10.0, previously called CFX-5. The problems typically manifest themselves as unintended streamwise gradients in the vertical mean wind speed and turbulence profiles as they travel through the computational domain. These gradients can be held responsible—at least partly—for the discrepancies that are sometimes found between seemingly identical CFD simulations performed with different CFD codes and between CFD simulations and measurements. This paper discusses the problem by focusing on the simulation of a neutrally stratified, fully developed, horizontally homogeneous ABL over uniformly rough, flat terrain. The problem and its negative consequences are discussed and suggestions to improve the CFD simulations are made.},

abstract = {Potentially dangerous events involving heavy gas dispersion and their severe consequences have been largely publicized by the media. Simplified models have been widely applied to describe the effects of these accidents. However, most simplified models deal with flat terrain scenarios and are based on quite crude simplifications of the complex phenomenology involved. In this paper the possibility of simulating the dispersion of heavy gas clouds over a large topographically complex area (tens of km) by a general purpose computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code is investigated. The aim is that of setting up a tool able to produce a realistic description of such dispersion processes, whose results can be useful in considering the question of when and by how much one can be misled by a simplified model. The paper is divided in two parts: the first part describes the use of CFD simulations to generate the micrometeorological parameters which characterize the site before the release of the toxic material, while the second part deals with the dispersion process itself. The geographical region examined is the industrial site of Priolo-Gargallo/Augusta in the eastern part of Sicily, covering an extension of 30 × 30 km2.},

abstract = {Abstract This paper, first of a two-part work, presents an overview of the development of a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solver in OpenFOAM platform to simulate the internal ventilation regime within an open pit including the effects of developed turbulence, buoyancy and stratification. To incorporate the effect of stratification in the simulations we have chosen a formulation that includes density as a variable in the system of equations, thus facilitating further study of buoyant flows. Given the importance of turbulence in this type of large-scale flows we have used Large Eddy Simulation (LES) to incorporate it in the calculation, using a Detached Eddy Simulation (DES) approach to solve the flow near walls. Specific initial and boundary conditions were defined. The results presented in this paper, including several tests of the solver where we compared our results with experimental or numerical data, have demonstrated the validity of using OpenFOAM to study this type of complex multiphysics problems. Especially advantageous in this regard are the flexibility provided by the modular structure of the code, the possibility of defining specific boundary and initial conditions for each case, and the ability of generating detailed meshes of complex geometries. Also we probed the benefits of using a DES approach, allowing us to solve developed turbulence and the interaction of the flow with detailed geometry. A second paper associated to this work will expose the application of the solver to large open pit mines, simulating the particular case of Chuquicamata, one of the largest open pit mines in the world, located in northern Chile.},

@article{Riddle2004a,
abstract = {The dispersion of gases in complex situations such as the case of buildings in close proximity is a difficult problem, but important for the safety of people living and working in such areas. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) provides a method to build and run models that can simulate gas dispersion in such geometrically complex situations; however, the accuracy of the results needs to be assessed. As a first step in such an assessment, this study considers the simulation of the dynamics of the basic atmospheric boundary layer using the FLUENT CFD code and the prediction of gas dispersion from a single stack. The CFD results are compared with the predictions from the Atmospheric Dispersion Modelling System (ADMS), a well tested and validated quasi-Gaussian model. When FLUENT was set up to simulate the neutrally stable atmospheric boundary layer, the mean velocity profiles were well predicted and were maintained with downwind distance. The algebraic Reynolds stress turbulence model provided the best predictions for the turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) and dissipation. The dissipation rate was maintained throughout the length of the model domain and, on average, the TKE levels were within 80{\%} of the expected values up to a height of 100m, but at the ground reduced to 50{\%} of the inlet values. Predictions of TKE using the simpler k–$\epsilon$ model turbulence was much poorer. Spread of the gas plume were predicted using an advection-diffusion (AD) method, a Lagrangian particle tracking (LP) method and a large eddy simulation (LES) method. The LP method gave the best results; the horizontal and vertical plume spreads were similar to those predicted by ADMS and ground level and plume centre line concentrations were close to ADMS values. However, some differences were observed with the ground level concentrations rising more rapidly with distance than for ADMS, but reaching similar peak values while the plume centreline concentrations dropped more rapidly than in ADMS. For the AD method the horizontal cross-wind plume spread was significantly lower than expected resulting in higher ground level concentrations than predicted by ADMS, an effect that was attributed to the isotropic formulation of the AD equation in FLUENT. The LES results were intermediate between the AD and LP predictions. Overall, the CFD simulations with the LP method were satisfactory; however, they could not be considered as an appropriate alternative to a model such as ADMS for normal atmospheric dispersion studies because of the much larger run times and the greater complexity of setting up model runs. CFD is more appropriate for applications that involve complex geometry that could not be simulated using ADMS; however, further studies are required to assess the ability of CFD to calculate dispersion in such situations, for instance, around groups of buildings and under a range of atmospheric stability conditions, rather than just the neutral stability considered in this paper.},

abstract = {During the period from 1977 to 1989, the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) conducted a liquefied gaseous fuels spill effects program under the sponsorship of the US Department of Energy, Department of Transportation, Gas Research Institute and others. The goal of this program was to develop and validate tools that could be used to predict the effects of a large liquefied gas spill through the execution of large scale field experiments and the development of computer models to make predictions for conditions under which tests could not be performed. Over the course of the program, three series of LNG spill experiments were performed to study cloud formation, dispersion, combustion and rapid phase transition (RPT) explosions. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of this program, the lessons learned from 12 years of research as well as some recommendations for the future. The general conclusion from this program is that cold, dense gas related phenomena can dominate the dispersion of a large volume, high release rate spill of LNG especially under low ambient wind speed and stable atmospheric conditions, and therefore, it is necessary to include a detailed and validated description of these phenomena in computer models to adequately predict the consequences of a release. Specific conclusions include:•LNG vapor clouds are lower and wider than trace gas clouds and tend to follow the downhill slope of terrain due to dampened vertical turbulence and gravity flow within the cloud. Under low wind speed, stable atmospheric conditions, a bifurcated, two lobed structure develops.•Navier–Stokes models provide the most complete description of LNG dispersion, while more highly parameterized Lagrangian models were found to be well suited to emergency response applications.•The measured heat flux from LNG vapor cloud burns exceeded levels necessary for third degree burns and were large enough to ignite most flammable materials.•RPTs are of two types, source generated and enrichment generated, and were observed to increase the burn area by a factor of two and to extend the downwind burn distance by 65{\%}. Additional large scale experiments and model development are recommended.},

In particular, the work dealt with the simulation of Coyote series trials, which conducted in 1981 by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and involved the release, dispersion, ignition and combustion of unconfined natural gas clouds in the open-air. In the computations, the CFD code CFX 5.7 was utilized which, in addition to the standard three-dimensional Navier–Stokes equations, incorporates the k–$\epsilon$ model for turbulence modeling, the Eddy Dissipation model for combustion and P1 model for radiation transport modeling. Computational thermal radiation histories were compared with experimental data from totally four trials showing a reasonably good agreement for several locations in the field. Discrepancies were laid on overestimation of the thermal load receipted at a certain location, nevertheless within a factor-of-two of the observed values. Moreover, positive peak overpressures were sufficiently low to indicate that the combustion of the cloud yielded a flash fire rather than an explosion.},

abstract = {An essential part of a safety analysis to evaluate the risks of a liquid hydrogen (LH2) containing system is the understanding of cryogenic pool spreading and its vaporization. It represents the initial step in an accident sequence with the inadvertent spillage of LH2, e.g., after failure of a transport container tank or the rupture of a pipeline. This stage of an accident scenario provides pertinent information as a source term for the subsequent analysis steps of atmospheric dispersion and, at presence of an ignition source, the combustion of the hydrogen–air vapor cloud. A computer model LAUV has been developed at the Research Center Juelich, which is able to simulate the spreading and vaporization of a cryogenic liquid under various conditions such as different grounds (solid, water). It is based on the so-called shallow-layer differential equations takingg into account physical phenomena such as ice formation, if the cryogen is spilled on a water surface. This paper gives a description of the computer model and its validation against existing experimental data. Furthermore, computational results are analyzed describing the prediction and quantification of the consequences of an LH2 spill for different cases. They also include the comparison of an LH2 spillage versus the corresponding release of other cryogens such as liquefied natural gas, liquid oxygen, and liquid nitrogen.},

abstract = {Photomechanical effects in polymeric materials and composites transduce light into mechanical work. The ability to control the intensity, polarization, placement, and duration of light irradiation is a distinctive and potentially useful tool to tailor the location, magnitude, and directionality of photogenerated mechanical work. Unfortunately, the work generated from photoresponsive materials is often slow and yields very small power densities, which diminish their potential use in applications. Here, we investigate photoinitiated snap-through in bistable arches formed from samples composed of azobenzene-functionalized polymers (both amorphous polyimides and liquid crystal polymer networks) and report orders-of-magnitude enhancement in actuation rates (approaching 10(2) mm/s) and powers (as much as 1 kW/m(3)). The contactless, ultra-fast actuation is observed at irradiation intensities {\textless}100 mW/cm(2). Due to the bistability and symmetry of the snap-through, reversible and bidirectional actuation is demonstrated. A model is developed to elucidate the underlying mechanics of the snap-through, specifically focusing on isolating the role of sample geometry, mechanical properties of the materials, and photomechanical strain. Using light to trigger contactless, ultrafast actuation in an otherwise passive structure is a potentially versatile tool to use in mechanical design at the micro-, meso-, and millimeter scales as actuators, as well as switches that can be triggered from large standoff distances, impulse generators for microvehicles, microfluidic valves and mixers in laboratory-on-chip devices, and adaptive optical elements.},

abstract = {This review attempts to summarize the physical models and advanced methods used in computational studies of gas–liquid two-phase jet flows encountered in atomization and spray processes. In traditional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based on Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) approach, physical modelling of atomization and sprays is an essential part of the two-phase flow computation. In more advanced CFD such as direct numerical simulation (DNS) and large-eddy simulation (LES), physical modelling of atomization and sprays is still inevitable. For multiphase flows, there is no model-free DNS since the interactions between different phases need to be modelled. DNS of multiphase flows based on the one-fluid formalism coupled with interface tracking algorithms seems to be a promising way forward, due to the advantageous lower costs compared with a multi-fluid approach. In LES of gas–liquid two-phase jet flows, subgrid-scale (SGS) models for complex multiphase flows are very immature. There is a lack of well-established SGS models to account for the interactions between the different phases. In this paper, physical modelling of atomization and sprays in the context of CFD is reviewed with modelling assumptions and limitations discussed. In addition, numerical methods used in advanced CFD of atomization and sprays are discussed, including high-order numerical schemes. Other relevant issues of modelling and simulation of atomization and sprays such as nozzle internal flow, dense spray, and multiscale modelling are also briefly reviewed.},

In addition, it is shown that the closure does predict a very strong influence of secondary strain terms for flow over curved surfaces.},

@article{Koopman1982,
abstract = {The U.S. Department of Energy sponsored a series of nine field experiments (Burro series) conducted jointly in 1980 by the Naval Weapons Center, China Lake, California, and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to determine the transport and dispersion of vapor from spills of liquefied natural gas (LNG) on water. The spill volume ranged from 24 to 39 m3, the spill rate from 11.3 to 18.4 m3/min, the wind speed from 1.8 to 9.1 m/s, and the atmospheric stability from unstable to slightly stable. An extensive array of instrumentation was deployed both upwind and downwind of the spill pond. Wind speed and direction, gas concentration, temperature, humidity, and heat flux from the ground were measured at different distances from the spill point and at different elevations relative to ground level. The wind and gas-concentration data were analyzed to further define the fluid dynamic and thermodynamic processes associated with the dispersion of the gas cloud. Data pertaining to differential boiling of LNG and observed rapid phase-transition explosions were also analyzed. The principal conclusions are summarized as follows: The turbulent processes in the lower atmospheric boundary layer dominated the transport and dispersion of gas for all experiments except Burro 8. Burro 8 was conducted under very low wind-speed conditions, and the gravity flow of the cold gas displaced the atmospheric flow, causing the wind speed within the cloud to drop essentially to zero. This has profound implications for hazard prediction from large accidental spills. High-frequency (3–5 Hz) gas-concentration measurements indicate that peak concentrations within the flammable limits are common with 10-s-average concentrations above 1{\%}. This implies a larger flammable extent than averaged data or calculations would indicate. Differential boiloff of LNG was observed with resultant enrichment of ethane and propane in the cloud at later times. This ethane-enriched region propagates downwind and represents an additional hazard since it is more easily detonated than the methane-rich region. Energetic rapid phase transition (RPT) explosions, though not expected, did occur under at least two different circumstances during the Burro 6 and 9 tests. These explosions were large enough to damage the facility and raise questions about the coupling of the RPT-produced shock wave into the ethane-rich region of the cloud.},

abstract = {Monin–Obukhov similarity theory (MOST) is commonly used to model the wind-speed profile at altitudes relevant to wind-power production (e.g. 10–200 m). Though reasonably accurate for unstable to weakly stable stratification, this approach becomes less accurate under increasingly stable stratification, largely due to the constant-flux surface layer assumed by MOST becoming shallower than the altitude range of interest. Furthermore, above the surface layer, the Coriolis force has a considerable influence on the wind-speed profile (in particular in the formation of low-level jets) that cannot be modelled using similarity theory. Our goal is to compare the accuracy of alternative extrapolation models that are more physically appropriate above the surface layer. Using data from the 213-m Cabauw meteorological tower in the Netherlands between July 2007 and June 2008, it is shown that MOST is accurate only at low altitudes and low stability, and breaks down at high altitudes and high stability. Local similarity is generally more accurate than MOST across all altitudes and stabilities, though the model requires turbulent flux data at multiple altitudes that is generally impractical. In contrast, a two-layer MOST–Ekman model is found to be comparable to the other models at low stability ranges and considerably more accurate in the high stability range, while requiring only a measure of surface stability and the geostrophic wind.},

It is shown that near the minimum film-boiling heat flux, the bubble spacing and growth rate is determined by Taylor Instability neglecting the effect of fluid depth and viscosity. Utilizing a simplified geometrical model, an analytical expression for the heat-transfer coefficient near the minimum in film pool boiling from a horizontal surface was derived. Combining this equation with the available correlation for the minimum heat flux yields an analytical equation for the temperature difference at the minimum, which defines the location of the minimum point. The above equations agree with the available experimental measurements made on n-pentane and carbon tetrachloride within ±10 per cent.},

abstract = {AbstractA recent National Research Council report highlighted the potential utility of atmospheric observations and models for detecting trends in concentrated emissions from localized regions, such as urban areas. The Salt Lake City (SLC), Utah, area was chosen for a pilot study to determine the feasibility of using ground-based sensors to identify trends in anthropogenic urban emissions over a range of time scales (from days to years). The Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) was combined with a Lagrangian particle dispersion model and an emission inventory to model carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations that can be compared with in situ measurements. An accurate representation of atmospheric transport requires a faithful modeling of the meteorological conditions. This study examines in detail the ability of different configurations of WRF to reproduce the observed local and mesoscale circulations, and the diurnal evolution of the planetary boundary layer (PBL) in the SLC area. Observations from the Vertical Transport and Mixing field experiment in 2000 were used to examine the sensitivity of WRF results to changes in the PBL parameterization and to the inclusion of an urban canopy model (UCM). Results show that for urban locations there is a clear benefit from parameterizing the urban canopy for simulation of the PBL and near-surface conditions, particularly for temperature evolution at night. Simulation of near-surface CO2 concentrations for a 2-week period in October 2006 showed that running WRF at high resolution (1.33 km) and with a UCM also improves the simulation of observed increases in CO2 during the early evening.},

@article{Pleim2007,
abstract = {Abstract The modeling of the atmospheric boundary layer during convective conditions has long been a major source of uncertainty in the numerical modeling of meteorological conditions and air quality. Much of the difficulty stems from the large range of turbulent scales that are effective in the convective boundary layer (CBL). Both small-scale turbulence that is subgrid in most mesoscale grid models and large-scale turbulence extending to the depth of the CBL are important for the vertical transport of atmospheric properties and chemical species. Eddy diffusion schemes assume that all of the turbulence is subgrid and therefore cannot realistically simulate convective conditions. Simple nonlocal closure PBL models, such as the Blackadar convective model that has been a mainstay PBL option in the fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University?National Center for Atmospheric Research Mesoscale Model (MM5) for many years and the original asymmetric convective model (ACM), also an option in MM5, represent large-scale transport driven by convective plumes but neglect small-scale, subgrid turbulent mixing. A new version of the ACM (ACM2) has been developed that includes the nonlocal scheme of the original ACM combined with an eddy diffusion scheme. Thus, the ACM2 is able to represent both the supergrid- and subgrid-scale components of turbulent transport in the convective boundary layer. Testing the ACM2 in one-dimensional form and comparing it with large-eddy simulations and field data from the 1999 Cooperative Atmosphere?Surface Exchange Study demonstrates that the new scheme accurately simulates PBL heights, profiles of fluxes and mean quantities, and surface-level values. The ACM2 performs equally well for both meteorological parameters (e.g., potential temperature, moisture variables, and winds) and trace chemical concentrations, which is an advantage over eddy diffusion models that include a nonlocal term in the form of a gradient adjustment.},

abstract = {Large reserves of natural gas exist worldwide, particularly in areas in which there is no market or where the resources exceed the demand; this natural gas is liquefied for shipping to areas where there is a demand. As the liquefied natural gas is a flammable substance, a leakage in this process may cause undesired events like fires and explosions. The consequence analysis is used to define the extent and nature of effects caused by undesired events and thus to quantify the damage caused by such events. Specific models are used to analyze the spills or jets of gas and liquid, gas dispersion, explosions and fires. The central step in the analysis of consequences is to determine the concentration of the vapor cloud of hazardous substances released into the atmosphere, in space and time. Gaussian and integral tools are extensively used in risk analysis, mainly to develop analysis about gas flow over flat terrain, providing fast dispersion estimations. Recently, with the computational advances, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tools are used to short and medium range gas dispersion scenarios. However the advantages and disadvantages of each approach according with the scenario evaluated have not been widely discussed. This paper evaluates, using a CFD model, the cloud dispersion of a LNG leakage. Then the results are compared with the results previously obtained by UDM (Unified Dispersion Model) and some advantages and disadvantages of each model are discussed. This study contributes to the decision making about the choice of most appropriated model to evaluate the consequences analysis. Copyright ? 2013 by ASME.},

Good conceptual models underlie successful mathematical theories. Models and theories are discussed here for deflagrations, detonations, diffusion flames, ignition, propellant combustion, and turbulent combustion. In many of these areas, the genesis of mathematical theories occurred during the past fifty years, and in all of them significant advances are anticipated in the future.

abstract = {The siting of facilities handling liquefied natural gas (LNG), whether for liquefaction, storage or regasification purposes, requires the hazards from potential releases to be evaluated. One of the consequences of an LNG release is the creation of a flammable vapor cloud, that may be pushed beyond the facility boundaries by the wind and thus present a hazard to the public. Therefore, numerical models are required to determine the footprint that may be covered by a flammable vapor cloud as a result of an LNG release. Several new models have been used in recent years for this type of simulations. This prompted the development of the "Model evaluation protocol for LNG vapor dispersion models" (MEP): a procedure aimed at evaluating quantitatively the ability of a model to accurately predict the dispersion of an LNG vapor cloud.This paper summarizes the MEP requirements and presents the results obtained from the application of the MEP to a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model - FLACS. The entire set of 33 experiments included in the model validation database were simulated using FLACS. The simulation results are reported and compared with the experimental data. A set of statistical performance measures are calculated based on the FLACS simulation results and compared with the acceptability criteria established in the MEP. The results of the evaluation demonstrate that FLACS can be considered a suitable model to accurately simulate the dispersion of vapor from an LNG release. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Recent developments in modelling the heating and evaporation of fuel droplets are reviewed, and unsolved problems are identified. It is noted that modelling transient droplet heating using steady-state correlations for the convective heat transfer coefficient can be misleading. At the initial stage of heating stationary droplets, the well known steady-state result Nu=2 leads to under prediction of the rate of heating, while at the final stage the same result leads to over prediction. The numerical analysis of droplet heating using the effective thermal conductivity model can be based on the analytical solution of the heat conduction equation inside the droplet. This approach was shown to have clear advantages compared with the approach based on the numerical solution of the same equation both from the point of view of accuracy and computer efficiency. When highly accurate calculations are not required, but CPU time economy is essential then the effect of finite thermal conductivity and re-circulation in droplets can be taken into account using the so called parabolic model. For practical applications in computation fluid dynamics (CFD) codes the simplified model for radiative heating, describing the average droplet absorption efficiency factor, appears to be the most useful both from the point of view of accuracy and CPU efficiency. Models describing the effects of multi-component droplets need to be considered when modelling realistic fuel droplet heating and evaporation. However, most of these models are still rather complicated, which limits their wide application in CFD codes. The Distillation Curve Model for multi-component droplets seems to be a reasonable compromise between accuracy and CPU efficiency. The systems of equations describing droplet heating and evaporation and autoignition of fuel vapour/air mixture in individual computational cells are stiff. Establishing hierarchy between these equations, and separate analysis of the equations for fast and slow variables may be a constructive way forward in analysing these systems.},

@article{Ermak1982,
abstract = {The predictions from three vapor dispersion models for cold dense gas releases are compared with the results from several 40 m3 LNG spill experiments conducted at China Lake, California, in 1980. The models vary considerably in the degree to which they approximate important physical phenomena and include restricting assumptions. The simplest model (GD), a modified Gaussian plume model, predicted a vapor cloud that was always too high and too narrow by a factor of 1.5 to 3. The second model (SLAB), a layer-averaged conservation equation model with one independent spatial variable (downwind distance), generally predicted the maximum distance to the lower flammability limit (LFL) and cloud width quite well. SLAB assumes the vertical concentration distribution is nearly uniform so that the vertical concentration gradient (∂c/∂z) is essentially zero from the ground up through most of the cloud and then very steep at the top of the cloud. This was generally not the case in these experiments, especially in the high wind speed tests, where the vertical concentration gradient was found to be more gradual throughout the cloud. The final model (FEM3) is a fully three-dimensional conservation equation model that generally predicted the concentration distribution in time and space rather well. A particular achievement of this model was the prediction of a bifurcated cloud structure observed in one experiment conducted with a low ambient wind speed. Both the SLAB and the FEM3 models accurately predicted the length of time required for the cloud to disperse to a level below the LFL, even in the low wind speed test where the vapor cloud lingered over the source region for a considerable length of time after the LNG spill was terminated.},

Subfilter conditional scalar dissipation is closed by the generalised MMC mixing model which enforces localisation in an extended space comprising of physical location and a reference mixture fraction; the latter is the filtered field from an LES simulation. A new fractal/gradient model controlling localisation in sparse simulations has been developed recently, and here it is tested on real flame conditions. Using one single localisation constant fm, simulation results with as few as 1 Lagrangian particle per 27 Eulerian cells show a good match to the measurements; particle number density effects are also explored.},

abstract = {Installation of effective safety measures to prevent and mitigate an accidental LNG release is critical. Water curtains are usually inexpensive, simple and reliable and currently have been recognized as an efficient technique to control and mitigate various hazards in the process industries including LNG industry. Actions of a water spray consist of a combination of several physical mechanisms. Detailed analysis of the complex mechanisms and the effects of water spray features to control and mitigate potential LNG vapor cloud are still unclear. This paper discusses the experimental research conducted by MKOPSC to study the physical phenomena involved and the effect of different types of water curtains parameters when applied for LNG vapor. The data from medium scale out-door experiments at the Brayton Fire Training School (BFTF), Texas, are summarized here to understand the relative importance of induced mechanical mixing effects, dilution with air, and heat transfer between water droplets and the LNG vapor. Field test results have determined that water curtains can reduce the concentration of the LNG vapor cloud. Due to the water curtain mechanisms of entrainment of air, dilution of vapor with entrained air, transfer of momentum and heat to the gas cloud, water curtain can disperse LNG vapor cloud to some extent.},

abstract = {A Lagrangian stochastic model (MicroSpray), able to simulate the airborne dispersion in complex terrain and in presence of obstacles, was modified to simulate the dispersion of dense gas clouds. This is accomplished by taking into account the following processes: negative buoyancy, gravity spreading and the particle's reflection at the bottom computational boundary. Elevated and ground level sources, continuous and instantaneous emissions, time varying sources, plumes with initial momentum (horizontal, vertical or oblique in any direction), plumes without initial momentum are considered. MicroSpray is part of the model system MSS, which also includes the diagnostic MicroSwift model for the reconstruction of the 3-D wind field in presence of obstacles and orography. To evaluate the MSS ability to simulate the dispersion of heavy gases, its simulation performances are compared in detail to two field experiments (Thorney Island and Kit Fox) and to a chlorine railway accident (Macdona). Then, a comprehensive analysis considering several experiments of the Modelers Data Archive is presented. The statistical analysis on the overall available data reveals that the performance of the new MicroSpray version for dense gas releases is generally reliable. For instance, the agreement between concentration predictions and observations is within a factor of two in the 72{\%} up to 99{\%} of the occurrences for the case studies considered. The values of other performance measures, such as correlation coefficient, geometric mean bias and geometric variance, mostly set in the ranges indicated as good-model performances in the specialized literature.},

abstract = {The purpose of the paper is to examine the relation between urban morphology (three-dimensional structure) and windiness. We regard a city as a porous obstacle, which is open at the top. We consider the interaction between the atmospheric boundary layer and a city to be both a function of the overall shape (silhouette or skyline) and the internal resistance to the flow caused by the friction when the wind flows over the urban surfaces. We regard the street pattern as an interconnected flow network with the crossings as nodes. Flow along the streets is generated by pressure differences. We here use a highly idealized city model consisting of a circular block divided into two or four equally large sectors. Two types of cases are studied, the first with only one street through the city model with different angles between the street and the oncoming wind. The second case also contains a perpendicularly crossing street (through the center). Both wind tunnel experiments and numerical flow computations (computational fluid dynamics, CFD) are used and compared. The general agreement between the two is good and the CFD method offers new possibilities for quantifying the urban wind environment.},

abstract = {Abstract The use of hydrogen gas as a fuel to be burned or to be spent in a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle is increasing. While hydrogen is a renewable and clean energy career, the safety aspects associated with it is still a key issue. Hydrogen has a wide flammability range and needs less energy to be ignited, compared to other common fuels. Experiments on hydrogen safety are not an economic and safe approach; hydrogen is a very dangerous substance, and expensive to test in a safe environment. Use of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFDs) is an alternative method to predict the behaviour of hydrogen gas after an accidental release. Providing the concentration profile for the area of concern, and the ability to investigate different parameters such as ventilation, obstacles' configurations and ignition sources are the advantages of using CFDs codes for the safe design of hydrogen stations and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. In the current study, a CFD based approach is proposed to evaluate the dispersion behaviour of hydrogen gas after a release from a hydrogen fuel cell car in an enclosed area. The fuel concentration profile in the compartment is produced, considering different ventilation conditions. Mitigation measures are also applied to improve the ventilation condition and decrease the fuel concentration below the flammable level. The proposed approach is useful for better design of safety measures to prevent consequent accidents or minimise the harmful impacts during an accident.},

abstract = {Release of hazardous materials in chemical industries is a major threat to surrounding areas. Current gas dispersion models like PHAST and FLACS, use release velocity, release elevation, meteorological parameters, and other related information as model input. In general, such information is not always available during an on-going accident. In this paper, we develop a fast prediction approach which could bypass the input parameters that are difficult to obtain and predict the released gas concentration at certain off-site location using parameters that could be obtained easily. The new approach is an integration of gas detectors, artificial neural network (ANN) and one of the aforementioned gas dispersion models. PHAST is applied to simulate numbers of release scenarios and the results containing the spatial and temporal distributions of released gas concentration are prepared as input and target data samples for training the neural network. The approach was applied to a case study involving a hypothetical chlorine release with varying release rates and atmospheric conditions. The results of the approach that are concentration and dispersion time profiles in the environmental sensitive locations were validated against PHAST. The validation shows highly correlations with PHAST and convincingly demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

abstract = {SUMMARY The Reynolds-averaged Navier?Stokes equations/ k ?$\epsilon$ approach is the popular and practical choice for carrying out simulations involving the atmospheric boundary layer. However, despite its widespread use, implementation of this approach is not without its challenges?even when considering the simplest case of horizontally homogeneous conditions. Most notably, the distributions of turbulent kinetic energy and its dissipation rate have proved difficult to maintain near solid boundaries, particularly in wind engineering applications where the near-wall grid is relatively coarse. In this work, the origin of these errors is investigated, and it is shown that by applying appropriate discretization schemes in conjunction with the Richards and Hoxey boundary conditions, truly invariant profiles of all flow properties can be obtained on such grids. Furthermore, with this finding, a wall treatment for coarse grids is proposed that could be implemented for non-homogeneous conditions. All simulations are carried out using OpenFOAM-1.6.x.

abstract = { ABSTRACTThe present study presents different k-$\epsilon$ turbulence closures for atmospheric boundary layer flows using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations that are consistent with inflow conditions from numerical weather prediction (NWP) simulations. Eight different mesoscale turbulence parameterisation schemes of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model are covered. To ensure consistency between the NWP and CFD simulations, different closure coefficients of the k − $\epsilon$ turbulence model for each NWP scheme are proposed. This is achieved by combining production–dissipation closure coefficient relationships based on the Monin–Obukhov similarity theory and the formulation based on the Coriolis parameter proposed by Detering and Etling. The proposed methodology has been implemented in the open source CFD toolbox OpenFOAM and is demonstrated at near-neutral stability conditions for the classical Askervein Hill case. },

abstract = {Large-eddy simulations (LES) still suffer from extremely large resources required for the resolution of the near-wall region, especially for high-Re flows. That is the main motivation for setting up hybrid LES–RANS methods. Meanwhile a variety of different hybrid concepts were proposed mostly relying on linear eddy-viscosity models. In the present study a hybrid approach based on an explicit algebraic Reynolds stress model (EARSM) is suggested. The model is applied in the RANS mode with the aim of accounting for the Reynolds stress anisotropy emerging especially in the near-wall region. For the implementation into a CFD code this anisotropy-resolving closure can be formally expressed in terms of a non-linear eddy-viscosity model (NLEVM). Its extra computational effort is small, still requiring solely the solution of one additional transport equation for the turbulent kinetic energy. In addition to this EARSM approach, a linear eddy-viscosity model (LEVM) is used in order to verify and emphasize the advantages of the non-linear model. In the present formulation the predefinition of RANS and LES regions is avoided and a gradual transition between both methods is assured. A dynamic interface criterion is suggested which relies on the modeled turbulent kinetic energy and the wall distance and thus automatically accounts for the characteristic properties of the flow. Furthermore, an enhanced version guaranteeing a sharp interface is proposed. The interface behavior is thoroughly investigated and it is shown how the method reacts on dynamic variations of the flow field. Both model variants, i.e. LEVM and EARSM, have been tested on the basis of the standard plane channel flow and even more detailed on the flow over a periodic arrangement of hills using fine and coarse grids.},

abstract = {Accidental releases of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from high-pressure piping have recently become a matter of growing interest. In the context of U.S. onshore LNG facility sitin, for example, LNG terminal developers have been required to demonstrate that the flammable vapor cloud (to the ½ LFL concentration) due to “jetting” and “flashing” from pressurized LNG releases will not extend beyond the property boundaries. The physical phenomena that occur as pressurized LNG flows from a breach are rather complex; as the release typically begins as a flashing jet that forms a gas-aerosol mixture as it expands to atmospheric pressure, which is followed by the rain-out or evaporation of the liquid droplets. The resulting vapor cloud, therefore, is likely to have very different characteristics from the “traditional” vapor cloud from a spill into an impoundment. Integral models are available that can calculate the formation and dispersion of the vapor cloud from a high-pressure release in the absence of obstacles or significant terrain features. In many practical cases, however, obstacles are likely to be present along the path of the two-phase jet (e.g., flange guards, nearby equipment, pipe racks, etc.) or along the path of the vapor cloud (e.g., buildings, vapor barriers, etc.). In order to properly account for the effect of these obstacles, a more sophisticated modeling approach is necessary. This paper discusses the simulation of high-pressure LNG releases using the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model FLACS. FLACS can overcome the limitations of simpler models by: 1) accounting for the effects of obstacles and complex geometry on the flow of air and vapors; 2) simulating the behavior of the two-phase jet release from the source location. Case studies are presented to demonstrate the application of FLACS to different high-pressure LNG release scenarios.},

abstract = {The initiation of turbulent non-premixed combustion of gaseous fuels through autoignition and through spark ignition is reviewed, motivated by the increasing relevance of these phenomena for new combustion technologies. The fundamentals of the associated turbulent-chemistry interactions are emphasized. Background information from corresponding laminar flow problems, relevant turbulent combustion modelling approaches, and the ignition of turbulent sprays are included. For both autoignition and spark ignition, examination of the reaction zones in mixture fraction space is revealing. We review experimental and numerical data on the stochastic nature of the emergence of autoignition kernels and of the creation of kernels and subsequent flame establishment following spark ignition, aiming to reveal the particular facet of the turbulence causing the stochasticity. In contrast to fully-fledged turbulent combustion where the effects of turbulence on the reaction are reasonably well-established, at least qualitatively, here the turbulence can cause trends that are not straightforward. Autoignition occurs usually away from stoichiometry at a "most reactive mixture fraction", which can be approximately determined from homogeneous or laminar flow autoignition calculations, and at locations in the turbulent flow with low scalar dissipation. Such locations may be the cores of vortices. Once autoignition has occurred at a time that is mostly affected by the history of the conditional scalar dissipation, the relative magnitudes of convection, diffusion and reaction can affect the stabilisation height of flames in sprays or jets. Modelling efforts based on the Conditional Moment Closure, advanced flamelet approaches, and the transported PDF method seem suitable for capturing many, but not yet all, of the trends observed in DNS or experiment. Further experiments and DNS of realistic fuels and at conditions demonstrating chemical complexities must be performed to examine more fully the effects of scalar dissipation and its fluctuations on pre-ignition reaction zones. The statistics of the first appearance of autoignition in transient problems and its connection with the mixing field must also be studied. Ignition from a localised spark has a stochastic character that depends on the mixture fraction sampled at the spark location and duration and the local scalar dissipation. The success or not of the subsequent flame depends on the development of turbulent edge or stratified flames. Only preliminary data exist on the propagation speed of such flames and on their quenching. A lot remains to be done on turbulent edge flame propagation in unreacted and partially-reacted mixtures with inhomogeneities, turbulent flame propagation in non-uniformly dispersed droplet mists, and the transient stabilisation process of recirculating flames. The nature of the flame generation process at very short timescales, i.e. before any appreciable propagation, by sparking in inhomogeneous mixtures needs also to be examined. The development of high repetition rate diagnostics, for single- and two-phase flows, and the development of modelling approaches capturing both premixed and non-premixed reaction zones in gaseous and spray combustion are necessary. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The FLACS CFD model, which can be used to estimate the flow and dispersion around buildings and other large roughness obstacles, has been evaluated with tracer data from several field experiments involving obstacle arrays. The following experiments were used in the evaluation exercise: Kit Fox (52 trials with puff and plume releases of slightly dense CO2gas in arrays of billboard-shaped obstacles), MUST (37 trials with puff releases of neutrally buoyant tracer gas in an array of 120 shipping containers), Prairie Grass (43 trials with continuous plume releases of neutrally buoyant tracer gas over a flat agricultural field), and the EMU L-shaped building (a wind tunnel experiment involving a release from an open door in the courtyard area of an L-shaped building). The primary focus is on the maximum concentration on the monitoring arcs. The performance statistics are consistently fairly good, with a median of 86{\%} of the predictions within a factor of two of the observations, a median relative bias suggesting a 20{\%} underprediction, a median relative scatter of about 50{\%}, and a median 20{\%} underprediction of the overall experiment maximum. These results are all well within the criteria of acceptance for dispersion models. Evaluations with the EMU L-shaped building data show that 72{\%} of FLACS predictions are within a factor of two of observations, and that the model can predict the dimensions of the recirculating cavity behind the building within a factor of two. It is suggested that these extensive data sets involving tracer releases in obstacle arrays be used to evaluate other CFD models. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Release of hazardous materials in urban areas is a major concern in industrial risk assessment. The presence of high population density in such areas multiplies the magnitude of the consequences. In urban areas, many buildings with complex geometries are involved leading to 3D flow fields that strongly influence gas dispersion. Representing such complex geometries simply but realistically in detailed simulation models can be cumbersome and often limit their utility. In this work, a methodology for the construction of 3D urban models and their importation into CFD models was developed through the access to spatial geodatabases, leading to a relatively fast and simple domain design technique. Moreover, since the magnitude of consequences depends on the absorbed dose which in turn depends on both concentration and exposure time, a simple methodology for dose evaluation was developed and implemented in a CFD code that enables the estimation of regions with a given death probability. The approach was developed and applied to a case study with different atmospheric stratification conditions. The results were then compared with those obtained using integral models. It was found that integral models can both overestimate and underestimate the magnitude of consequences related to hazardous material releases in urban areas.},

abstract = {Using direct numerical simulation, we investigate stationary and homogeneous shear-driven turbulence in various stratifications, ranging from neutral to very stable. To attain and maintain a stationary flow, we throttle the mean shear so that the net production stays constant for all times. This results in a flow that is characterized solely by its mean shear and its mean buoyancy gradient, independent of initial conditions. The method of throttling is validated by comparison with experimental spectra in the case of neutral stratification. With increasing stratification comes the emergence of vertically sheared large-scale horizontal motions that preclude a straightforward interpretation of flow statistics. However, once these motions are excluded, simply by subtracting the horizontal average, the underlying flow appears amenable to the standard methods of turbulence analysis. It is shown that a direct acknowledgement of the confining influence of the periodic simulation box can lead to a meaningful physical interpretation of the large scales. Once an appropriate confinement scale is identified, many features, including horizontal spectra, flux–gradient relationships and length scales, of stratified sheared turbulence can be readily understood, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in terms of Monin–Obukhov similarity theory. Finally, the similarity-theory framework is used to interpret the scaling of the vertical diapycnal diffusivity in stratified turbulence.},

abstract = {In large eddy simulations (LES) of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL), the choice of inflow method and the specification of surface roughness are crucial for obtaining accurate results. The consistency between inflow conditions and wall boundary condition has been investigated in depth for the RANS approach, whereas it needs further analysis for LES. This paper investigates the combined effect of inflow method and aerodynamic roughness length for LES of the neutral ABL. Three basic inflow generators in combination with three terrain types are evaluated in terms of streamwise homogeneity of the vertical profiles of mean velocity and turbulence kinetic energy. The results show that the precursor method best preserves the homogeneity of the profiles for all roughness lengths considered, with mean absolute deviations up to 0.7{\%} for mean velocity and 3.5{\%} for turbulence kinetic energy at the outlet of the computational domain. Among the synthetic methods, the Vortex Method performs satisfactorily for mean velocity and, to a lesser extent, turbulence kinetic energy, whereas the random flow generation (RFG) method leads to the largest deviations from the target profiles. Finally, the value of the aerodynamic roughness length is found to only weakly influence the performance of the inflow methods considered.},

@article{Hong2006,
abstract = {Abstract This paper proposes a revised vertical diffusion package with a nonlocal turbulent mixing coefficient in the planetary boundary layer (PBL). Based on the study of Noh et al. and accumulated results of the behavior of the Hong and Pan algorithm, a revised vertical diffusion algorithm that is suitable for weather forecasting and climate prediction models is developed. The major ingredient of the revision is the inclusion of an explicit treatment of entrainment processes at the top of the PBL. The new diffusion package is called the Yonsei University PBL (YSU PBL). In a one-dimensional offline test framework, the revised scheme is found to improve several features compared with the Hong and Pan implementation. The YSU PBL increases boundary layer mixing in the thermally induced free convection regime and decreases it in the mechanically induced forced convection regime, which alleviates the well-known problems in the Medium-Range Forecast (MRF) PBL. Excessive mixing in the mixed layer in the presence of strong winds is resolved. Overly rapid growth of the PBL in the case of the Hong and Pan is also rectified. The scheme has been successfully implemented in the Weather Research and Forecast model producing a more realistic structure of the PBL and its development. In a case study of a frontal tornado outbreak, it is found that some systematic biases of the large-scale features such as an afternoon cold bias at 850 hPa in the MRF PBL are resolved. Consequently, the new scheme does a better job in reproducing the convective inhibition. Because the convective inhibition is accurately predicted, widespread light precipitation ahead of a front, in the case of the MRF PBL, is reduced. In the frontal region, the YSU PBL scheme improves some characteristics, such as a double line of intense convection. This is because the boundary layer from the YSU PBL scheme remains less diluted by entrainment leaving more fuel for severe convection when the front triggers it.},

abstract = {Pool and vapor cloud characteristics of an acetone spill issuing from the downstream wall of a flow obstruction oriented perpendicular to a uniform flow were investigated experimentally. Data indicate that the spill event was largely governed by the temperature of the surface in relation to the boiling point of the spilled liquid. The free stream velocity (ranging from 0.75 to 3.0m/s) also impacted the spreading of the spill. Planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) was used to measure acetone vapor concentrations during the transient pool spreading and vaporization in a window 60cm long by 50cm high and located downstream of the 16cm high obstruction. The recirculation region induced by the flow obstruction caused upstream transport of the acetone vapor along the spill surface, after which it was convected vertically along the obstruction wall before being entrained into the flow and convected downstream. The recirculating flow caused regions of vapor within the flammability limits to be localized near the flow obstruction. These regions moved into and out of the measurement plane by large three-dimensional flow structures. The flammable region of the evolved vapor cloud was observed to grow well past the downstream edge of the measurement domain. With decreasing wind speeds, both the mass of acetone vapor within the flammability limits and the total spill event time increased significantly. The data presented herein provides a basis for validating future spill models of hazardous chemical releases, where complex turbulent flow modeling must be coupled with spill spreading and vaporization dynamics.},

abstract = {We consider large-eddy simulation (LES) of buoyant plumes in uniform and stably stratified environments. We show that in the former case the results agree well with the simple plume model of Morton, Taylor {\&} Turner (Proc. R. Soc. Lond. A, vol. 234, 1956, p. 1). In particular, we calculate an entrainment constant which is consistent with laboratory and field measurements and find no significant difference between the radial spreading rates of vertical velocity and buoyancy. In a stably stratified environment, the LES plume shows better agreement with Morton et al. (1956) below the level at which the buoyancy first vanishes than above this level. Above the level of neutral buoyancy, the LES plume is characterized by an ascending core of negative buoyancy surrounded by a descending annulus of positive buoyancy. We compare the LES data with the model of Bloomfield {\&} Kerr (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 424, 2000, p. 197), which explicitly accounts for these coherent motions. The model exhibits many qualitative aspects of the LES plume and quantitative agreement can be improved by adjusting the downward volume flux relative to the upward volume flux in a manner consistent with the LES plume. This simple adjustment, along with revised values of the entrainment constants, represents the combined effects of an overturning region at the top of the plume (where a fluid element reverses direction), ‘plume-top' entrainment (whereby the plume entrains ambient fluid above the plume) as well as lateral entrainment and detrainment processes (both external and internal) occurring above the top of the model plume.},

Many of the questions that are considered relate to the use of computational fluid dynamic (CFD) models, which appear to offer the best potential for realistic modeling to determine vapor cloud exclusion zones that result from LNG spills into impounded areas with or without dispersion in the presence of other obstacles to the wind flow. Failure to use CFD models, which are already approved by the regulation, and continued use of practices which have been demonstrated to be in error, raises important questions of credibility as well as denies the applicant full use of scientific tools that are available to optimize the design of such facilities so as to best provide for safety of the public.},

@article{Cormier2009,
abstract = {The increased demand for Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) has led to the construction of several new LNG terminals in the United States (US) and around the world. To ensure the safety of the public, consequence modeling is used to estimate exclusion distances. For LNG industry, the purpose of identifying these exclusion distances is to protect the public from being reached by flammable vapors during a release and they are determined by one-half of the Lower Flammability Limit (half LFL, 2.5{\%}v/v). Since LNG vapors are heavier-than-air when released into atmosphere, it goes through several stages, which are respectively characterized as negative, neutral, and positively buoyant as it dilutes. To address this complex phenomenon, several simple models were developed and tested against large scale experimental data for the past three decades. This paper was derived from the development of design and safety specifications for LNG facilities based on experimental and theoretical research at Mary Kay O'Connor Process Safety Center (MKOPSC). Medium-scale LNG tests were performed at the Brayton Fire Training Field (BFTF), Texas A{\&}M University to provide data for this specific research. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was used to perform consequence modeling for LNG release. The CFD code showed good agreement with the data collected during the November 2007 test performed at BFTF. This paper showed the simulation setup and the comparison with data collected for two scenarios: release on water and on dry concrete. Once the model was tuned against experimental data, it was used in a sensitivity analysis on parameters to assess the effects on the LFL distance and the concentration levels. Furthermore, three turbulence models were compared. The source term was composed of turbulence intensity at the source, LNG pool geometry, mass evaporation rate, and LNG pool area. The vapor dispersion parameters were wind velocity, sensible heat flux, and obstacles effects. It was concluded that at low wind velocity, the source term parameters strongly influenced the LFL distance and the concentration level. On the other hand, at high wind velocity, the source term parameter had a slight effect on the LFL distance and the concentration levels.},

@article{Gavelli2009,
abstract = {The use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models to simulate LNG vapor dispersion scenarios has been growing steadily over the last few years, with applications to LNG spills on land as well as on water. Before a CFD model may be used to predict the vapor dispersion hazard distances for a hypothetical LNG spill scenario, it is necessary for the model to be validated with respect to relevant experimental data. As part of a joint-industry project aimed at validating the CFD methodology, the LNG vapor source term, including the turbulence level associated with the evaporation process vapors was quantified for one of the Falcon tests. This paper presents the method that was used to quantify the turbulent intensity of evaporating LNG, by analyzing the video images of one of the Falcon tests, which involved LNG spills onto a water pond. The measured rate of LNG pool growth and spreading and the quantified turbulence intensity that were obtained from the image analysis were used as the LNG vapor source term in the CFD model to simulate the Falcon-1 LNG spill test. Several CFD simulations were performed, using a vaporization flux of 0.127 kg/m2 s, radial and outward spreading velocities of 1.53 and 0.55 m/s respectively, and a range of turbulence kinetic energy values between 2.9 and 28.8 m2/s2. The resulting growth and spread of the vapor cloud within the impounded area and outside of it were found to match the observed behavior and the experimental measured data. The results of the analysis presented in this paper demonstrate that a detailed and accurate definition of the LNG vapor source term is critical in order for any vapor cloud dispersion simulation to provide useful and reliable results.},

abstract = {The pollutants decrease their concentration into the atmosphere due to a process called dispersion. This phenomenon depends on the chemical–physical properties of the discharged substance, on the characteristics of the release, and on the meteorological and topographical characteristics of the area. The “dispersion” term summarizes various events and it is possible to define three regions after a discharge: the first one, close to discharge source, where the inertial forces could be predominant, the second one, where the buoyancy forces are important, and the third zone, where the plume does not have memory of the source due to dilution with air and the pollutant is gradually diluted due to the atmospheric turbulent motion. The available simulation models for the description of dispersion process into the atmosphere can be classified into three types: 3D models (computational fluid dynamics), integral models (flux tube model), and Gaussian models. In this article, after a brief introduction to the physics of the atmosphere, the main models available for the simulation of the dispersion phenomenon will be introduced and described.},

Explicit representation of all scales is not feasible due to limitations of computational cost, and modeling of unresolved physical features is required.

A sharp-interface phase change model which was originally developed for pool boiling flows is extended to convective boiling flows. For physical scales smaller than the smallest flow scales (smaller than the grid size), a micro-scale model was used. After a grid dependency study and a parametric study for the contact angle, four cases of simulation were carried out with different wall superheat and degree of subcooling. The flow structures around the growing bubble were investigated together with the accompanying physics. The relation between the heat flux evolution and the bubble growth was studied, along with investigations of bubble diameter and bubble base diameter evolutions across the four cases. As a validation, the evolutions of bubble diameter and bubble base diameter were compared to experimental observations. The bubble departure period and the bubble shapes show good agreement between the experiment and the simulation, although the Reynolds number of the simulation cases is relatively low.},

abstract = {The international transport, storage and utilisation of LNG is growing rapidly. Whilst the LNG industry has an excellent safety record, the possibility of an accidental release cannot be discounted. Internationally-accepted standards, such as the 59A Standard of the US National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), provide direction on the assessment of LNG spill hazards and hazard range criteria which must be met. Modelling of the atmospheric dispersion of LNG vapour from accidental spills is one of the critical steps in such hazard analyses. This paper describes a comprehensive evaluation protocol devised for the 59A Standard, specifically for the assessment of LNG vapour dispersion models. The evaluation protocol is based on methodologies developed in previous European Union studies, which have been extended, significantly adapted and tailored to the specific requirements of the evaluation of models for the dispersion of LNG vapour. The protocol comprises scientific evaluation of the numerical and physical basis of models for the dispersion of LNG vapour, model verification, and validation; resulting in a comprehensive model evaluation report which includes qualitative and quantitative criteria for model acceptance. A supporting suite of validation data, and guidance on the use of this data, has also been produced. The NFPA 59A (2009) standard states that LNG vapour dispersion models are acceptable for use if they have been evaluated in accordance with this protocol. {\textcopyright} 2012.},

abstract = {The simulation of Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL) flows is commonly performed using commercial CFD codes with RANS turbulence modeling, applying the standard k-$\epsilon$ model. However, when applied to the simulation of the homogenous ABL, this approach may result in an undesired decay of the velocity and turbulent fully–developed profiles specified at the inlet of the computational domain. This behavior is due to an inconsistency between turbulence model, inflow conditions and wall function formulation. An approach has been introduced recently to overcome this problem, which consists in the modification of the turbulence model and wall function formulation to retrieve an overall consistent treatment of the neutral ABL. Such methodology, previously applied to simulation of the atmospheric boundary layer over flat terrain and ground-mounted bluff bodies, is here applied to the simulation of the flow over complex terrains and hills, at wind tunnel and atmosphere scale. In a time of limited scientific funding, the availability of open source CFD software such as OpenFOAM is a very attractive option to investigate; therefore, a comparison between OpenFOAM and the commercial code FLUENT 13.0 has been carried out in the present paper. The potential of the proposed methodology and the satisfactory performances of OpenFOAM are demonstrated.},

abstract = {The use of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and in particular Large Eddy Simulation (LES) codes to model fires provides an efficient tool for the prediction of large-scale effects that include plume characteristics, combustion product dispersion, and heat effects to adjacent objects. This paper illustrates the strengths of the Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS), an LES code developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), through several small and large-scale validation runs and process safety applications. The paper presents two fire experiments—a small room fire and a large (15m diameter) pool fire. The model results are compared to experimental data and demonstrate good agreement between the models and data. The validation work is then extended to demonstrate applicability to process safety concerns by detailing a model of a tank farm fire and a model of the ignition of a gaseous fuel in a confined space. In this simulation, a room was filled with propane, given time to disperse, and was then ignited. The model yields accurate results of the dispersion of the gas throughout the space. This information can be used to determine flammability and explosive limits in a space and can be used in subsequent models to determine the pressure and temperature waves that would result from an explosion. The model dispersion results were compared to an experiment performed by Factory Mutual. Using the above examples, this paper will demonstrate that FDS is ideally suited to build realistic models of process geometries in which large scale explosion and fire failure risks can be evaluated with several distinct advantages over more traditional CFD codes. Namely transient solutions to fire and explosion growth can be produced with less sophisticated hardware (lower cost) than needed for traditional CFD codes (PC type computer verses UNIX workstation) and can be solved for longer time histories (on the order of hundreds of seconds of computed time) with minimal computer resources and length of model run. Additionally results that are produced can be analyzed, viewed, and tabulated during and following a model run within a PC environment. There are some tradeoffs, however, as rapid computations in PC's may require a sacrifice in the grid resolution or in the sub-grid modeling, depending on the size of the geometry modeled.},

abstract = {Quantification of spatial and temporal concentration profiles of vapor clouds resulting from accidental loss of containment of toxic and/or flammable substances is of great importance as correct prediction of spatial and temporal profiles can not only help in designing mitigation/prevention equipment such as gas detection alarms and shutdown procedures but also help decide on modifications that may help prevent any escalation of the event. The most commonly used models – SLAB (Ermak, 1990), HEGADAS (Colenbrander, 1980), DEGADIS (Spicer {\&} Havens, 1989), HGSYSTEM (Witlox {\&} McFarlane, 1994), PHAST (DNV, 2007), ALOHA (EPA {\&} NOAA, 2007), SCIPUFF (Sykes, Parker, Henn, {\&} Chowdhury, 2007), TRACE (SAFER Systems, 2009), etc. – for simulation of dense gas dispersion consider the dispersion over a flat featureless plain and are unable to consider the effect of presence of obstacles in the path of dispersing medium. In this context, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has been recognized as a potent tool for realistic estimation of consequence of accidental loss of containment because of its ability to take into account the effect of complex terrain and obstacles present in the path of dispersing fluid. The key to a successful application of CFD in dispersion simulation lies in the accuracy with which the effect of turbulence generated due to the presence of obstacles is assessed. Hence a correct choice of the most appropriate turbulence model is crucial to a successful implementation of CFD in the modeling and simulation of dispersion of toxic and/or flammable substances. In this paper an attempt has been made to employ CFD in the assessment of heavy gas dispersion in presence of obstacles. For this purpose several turbulence models were studied for simulating the experiments conducted earlier by Health and Safety Executive, (HSE) U.K. at Thorney Island, USA (Lees, 2005). From the various experiments done at that time, the findings of Trial 26 have been used by us to see which turbulence model enables the best fit of the CFD simulation with the actual findings. It is found that the realizable k–ɛ model was the most apt and enabled the closest prediction of the actual findings in terms of spatial and temporal concentration profiles. It was also able to capture the phenomenon of gravity slumping associated with dense gas dispersion.},

Heat Transfer, 125, pp. 1106–1115) for quasi-stationary heat transfer to single vapor bubbles. In contrast to the preceding model, fully transient heat and fluid flow is computed with a free surface of the rising bubble and a periodic calculation of repeated cycles of bubble growth, detachment, and rise, requiring only specification of the waiting time between successive bubbles. Additionally, microscopic effects at the foot of the bubble are considered. The model is verified by comparing computed with measured heat transfer coefficients. Typical results for heat and mass transfer to a single vapor bubble are shown at all time steps of the bubble cycle. By means of the model the transient heat flow through different interfaces, e.g., wall/liquid or liquid/vapor, is computed for the whole bubble cycle. Thus, it was possible to evaluate the influence of transient heat conduction, heat storage, and convection in liquid as well as heat transfer in the wall on overall heat transfer performance.},

These parameters are used in conjunction with meteorological measurements to characterize the vertical structure of the wind, temperature, and turbulence. AERMOD?s method for considering both the vertical inhomogeneity of the meteorological characteristics and the influence of terrain are explained. The model?s concentration estimates are based on a steady-state plume approach with significant improvements over commonly applied regulatory dispersion models. Complex terrain influences are provided by combining a horizontal plume state and a terrain-following state. Dispersion algorithms are specified for convective and stable conditions, urban and rural areas, and in the influence of buildings and other structures.

The paper discusses how to improve Webber's model (1990) for evaluating the liquid pool dynamics in terms of spreading (onto land and water) and evaporation rates. In particular, our attention was devoted to the following points: friction term in presence of film boiling; evaluation of the friction velocity; determination of the wind profile index; evaluation of the conductive heat flux; the pool radius dynamics; turbulent mixing onto water; dispersion model input data. The paper presents, also, how to couple the proposed model to the pool burning dynamics. This allows simulating the burning of a spreading pool. Thanks to its prompt response in terms of CPU time, the proposed model is helpful not only under risk assessment or under emergency preparedness, but also during accident response. A comparison between experimental data and the model predictions validates the model effectiveness in simulating real accidental events.},

@phdthesis{ARNTZEN1998,
abstract = {This thesis analyses and presents new models for modelling of turbulent reactive flows for CFD simulation of gas explosions in complex geometries like offshore modules. The most important aspects determining the course of a gas explosion in a complex geometry are the development of turbulence and the corresponding increase in the combustion rate during the explosion. To be able to model the process it is necessary to use a CFD code as a starting point, provided with a suitable turbulence and combustion model. The modelling and calculations are done in a 3D finite volume CFD code, where complex geometries are represented by a porosity concept, which gives porosity on the grid cell faces, depending on what is inside the cell. The turbulent flow field is modelled with the k-$\epsilon$ turbulence model. The turbulent flow field behind obstructions, which should produce turbulence, is not resolved for smaller geometry. Subgrid models are therefore used for production of turbulence from geometry not fully resolved on the grid. Results from LDA measurements around obstructions in steady and transient turbulent flows have been analysed and the turbulence models have been improved to handle transient, subgrid and reactive flows. The combustion is modelled with a burning velocity model, and a flame model which incorporates the burning velocity into the code. Two different flame models have been developed. SIF, which treats the flame as a interface between reactants and products, and the $\beta$- model where the reaction zone is resolved with about 3 grid cells. The flame normally starts with a quasi laminar burning velocity, due to flame instabilities, modelled as function of flame radius and laminar burning velocity. As the flow field becomes turbulent, the flame uses a turbulent burning velocity model, based on experimental data presented by Bradley, as function of turbulence parameters and laminar burning velocity. The extrapolation of these data is evaluated. The laminar burning velocity is modelled as function of gas mixture, equivalence ratio, pressure and temperature in reactant. Pressure/time curves from a range of hydrocarbon gas explosion experiments have been compared with simulations, which in most cases shows good agreement. In simulation of these experiments a range of parameters have been varied, as gas mixture, congestion, obstructions, confinement, scale and grid resolution.},

The simulations have taken into account the effects of gravity, time-dependent downwind and crosswind dispersion, and terrain. Experimental data from the Burro series field tests, and results from integral model (DEGADIS) have been used to assess the validity of simulation results, which were found to compare better with experimental data than the commonly used integral model DEGADIS. The average relative error in maximum downwind gas concentration between CFD predictions and experimental data was 19.62{\%}. The validated CFD model was then used to perform risk assessment for most-likely-spill scenario at LNG stations as described in the standard of NFPA 59A (2009) “Standard for the Production, Storage and Handling of Liquefied Natural Gas”. Simulations were conducted to calculate the gas dispersion behaviour in the presence of obstacles (dikes walls). Interestingly for spill at a higher elevation, e.g., tank top, the effect of impounding dikes on the affected area was minimal. However, the impoundment zone did affect the wind velocity field in general, and generated a swirl inside it, which then played an important function in confining the dispersion cloud inside the dike. For most cases, almost 75{\%} of the dispersed vapour was retained inside the impoundment zone. The finding and analysis presented here will provide an important tool for designing LNG plant layout and site selection.},

abstract = {Abstract A three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model is developed to simulate urban flow and dispersion, to understand fluid dynamical processes therein, and to provide practical solutions to some emerging problems of urban air pollution. The governing equations are the Reynolds-averaged equations of momentum, mass continuity, heat, and other scalar (here, passive pollutant) under the Boussinesq approximation. The Reynolds stresses and turbulent fluxes are parameterized using the eddy diffusivity approach. The turbulent diffusivities of momentum, heat, and pollutant concentration are calculated using the prognostic equations of turbulent kinetic energy and its dissipation rate. The set of governing equations is solved numerically on a staggered, nonuniform grid system using a finite-volume method with the semi-implicit method for pressure-linked equation (SIMPLE) algorithm. The CFD model is tested for three different building configurations: infinitely long canyon, long canyon of finite l...},

abstract = {Potentially dangerous events involving heavy gas dispersion and their severe consequences have been largely publicized by the media. Simplified models have been widely applied to describe the effects of these accidents. However, most simplified models deal with flat terrain scenarios and are based on quite crude simplifications of the complex phenomenology involved. In this paper the possibility of simulating the dispersion of heavy gas clouds over a large topographically complex area (tens of km) by a general purpose computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code is investigated. The aim is that of setting up a tool able to produce a realistic description of such dispersion processes, whose results can be useful in considering the question of when and by how much one can be misled by a simplified model. The paper is divided in two parts: the first part describes the use of CFD simulations to generate the micrometeorological parameters which characterize the site before the release of the toxic material, while the second part deals with the dispersion process itself. The geographical region examined is the industrial site of Priolo-Gargallo/Augusta in the eastern part of Sicily, covering an extension of 30 × 30 km2.},

Examples of evaporation in smooth boundary layer flows are given and a new semi-empirical procedure is proposed for taking into account the influence of a transition in surface roughness on the rate of evaporation. The effect of high concentrations on the vertical transport of vapour is taken into account numerically by the introduction of a well-defined effective diffusion coefficient. The method has been found to work satisfactorily and accounts for the large increase in evaporation rate near the boiling point of a liquid. A special mathematical procedure is presented for describing the dispersion of vapour clouds from boiling liquids. Without the introduction of a vertical momentum balance, the procedure allows, in a simple manner for the generation of a concentrated vapour cloud above the liquid pool. Also, it provides a fully consistent description of non-boiling and boiling liquids.},

abstract = {A dispersion model validation study is presented for atmospheric releases of dense-phase carbon dioxide (CO2). Predictions from an integral model and two different Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models are compared to data from field-scale experiments conducted by INERIS, as part of the EU-funded CO2PipeHaz project. The experiments studied consist of a 2 m3 vessel fitted with a short pipe, from which CO2 was discharged into the atmosphere through either a 6 mm or 25 mm diameter orifice. Comparisons are made to measured temperatures and concentrations in the multi-phase CO2 jets. The integral dispersion model tested is DNV Phast and the two CFD models are ANSYS-CFX and a research and development version of FLACS, both of which adopt a Lagrangian particle-tracking approach to simulate the sublimating solid CO2 particles in the jet. Source conditions for the CFD models are taken from a sophisticated near-field CFD model developed by the University of Leeds that simulates the multi-phase, compressible flow in the expansion region of the CO2 jet, close to the orifice. Overall, the predicted concentrations from the various models are found to be in reasonable agreement with the measurements, but generally in poorer agreement than has been reported previously for similar dispersion models in other dense-phase CO2 release experiments. The ANSYS-CFX model is shown to be sensitive to the way in which the source conditions are prescribed, while FLACS shows some sensitivity to the solid CO2 particle size. Difficulties in interpreting the results from one of the tests, which featured some time-varying phenomena, are also discussed. The study provides useful insight into the coupling of near- and far-field dispersion models, and the strengths and weaknesses of different modelling approaches. These findings contribute to the assessment of potential hazards presented by Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) infrastructure.},

abstract = {This paper presents a generic, high-level risk assessment of the global operation of ocean-going liquefied natural gas (LNG) carriers. The analysis collects and combines information from several sources such as an initial hazid, a thorough review of historic LNG accidents, review of previous studies, published damage statistics and expert judgement, and develops modular risk models for critical accident scenarios. In accordance with these risk models, available information from different sources has been structured in the form of event trees for different generic accident categories. In this way, high-risk areas pertaining to LNG shipping operations have been identified. The major contributions to the risk associated with LNG shipping are found to stem from five generic accident categories, i.e. collision, grounding, contact, fire and explosion, and events occurring while loading or unloading LNG at the terminal. Of these, collision risk was found to be the highest. According to the risk analysis presented in this paper, both the individual and the societal risk level associated with LNG carrier operations lie within the As Low As Reasonable Practicable (ALARP) area, meaning that further risk reduction should be required only if available cost-effective risk control options could be identified. This paper also includes a critical review of the various components of the risk models and hence identifies areas of improvements and suggests topics for further research.},

Furthermore for better description of air flow in the computation domain for the desired atmospheric stability the periodic boundary conditions were used on both side boundaries. The initial two-phase flow of the released ammonia was also included. The liquid phase was modelled as droplets using discrete particle modelling, i.e. the Euler–Lagrangian approach for continuous and discrete phases. The main attention was focused on the description of the equilibrium ABL (atmospheric boundary layer) as it is an important aspect in dispersion modelling. Therefore it was necessary to ensure that appropriate turbulence levels are achieved and maintained throughout the domain.},

abstract = {Abstract Natural gas liquefaction systems are based on refrigeration cycles – they consist of the same operations such as heat exchange, compression and expansion, but they have different layouts, components and working fluids. The design of these systems requires a preliminary simulation and evaluation of their performance. However, the thermodynamic models used for this purpose are characterised by different mathematical formulations, ranges of application and levels of accuracy. This may lead to inconsistent results when estimating hydrocarbon properties and assessing the efficiency of a given process. This paper presents a thorough comparison of six equations of state widely used in the academia and industry, including the GERG-2008 model, which has recently been adopted as an ISO standard for natural gases. These models are used to (i) estimate the thermophysical properties of a Danish natural gas, (ii) simulate, and (iii) optimise liquefaction systems. Three case studies are considered: a cascade layout with three pure refrigerants, a single mixed-refrigerant unit, and an expander-based configuration. Significant deviations are found between all property models, and in all case studies. The main discrepancies are related to the prediction of the energy flows (up to 7{\%}) and to the heat exchanger conductances (up to 11{\%}), and they are not systematic errors. The results illustrate the superiority of using the GERG-2008 model for designing gas processes in real applications, with the aim of reducing their energy use. They demonstrate as well that particular caution should be exercised when extrapolating the results of the conventional thermodynamic models to the actual conception of the gas liquefaction chain.},

abstract = {Current interest in the shipment of liquefied natural gas (LNG) has renewed the debate about the safety of shipping large volumes of flammable fuels. The size of a spreading pool following a release of LNG from an LNG tank ship has been the subject of numerous papers and studies dating back to the mid-1970s. Several papers have presented idealized views of how the LNG would be released and spread across a quiescent water surface. There is a considerable amount of publicly available material describing these idealized releases, but little discussion of how other flammable fuels would behave if released from similar sized ships. The purpose of this paper is to determine whether the models currently available from the United States Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) can be used to simulate the release, spreading, vaporization, and pool fire impacts for materials other than LNG, and if so, identify which material-specific parameters are required. The review of the basic equations and principles in FERC's LNG release, spreading, and burning models did not reveal a critical fault that would prevent their use in evaluating the consequences of other flammable fluid releases. With the correct physical data, the models can be used with the same level of confidence for materials such as LPG and gasoline as they are for LNG.},

abstract = {Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tools are increasingly employed for quantifying incident consequences in quantitative risk analysis (QRA) calculations in the process industry. However, these tools must be validated against representative experimental data, involving combined release and ignition scenarios, in order to have a real predictive capability. Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe (FZK) has recently carried out experiments involving vertically upwards hydrogen releases with different release rates and velocities impinging on a plate in two different geometrical configurations. The dispersed cloud was subsequently ignited and resulting explosion overpressures recorded. Blind CFD simulations were carried out prior to the experiments to predict the results. The simulated gas concentrations are found to correlate reasonably well with observations. The overpressures subsequent to ignition obtained in the blind predictions could not be compared directly as the ignition points chosen in the experiments were somewhat different from those used in the blind simulations, but the pressure levels were similar. Simulations carried out subsequently with the same ignition position as those in the experiments compared reasonably well with the observations. This agreement points to the ability of the CFD tool FLACS to model such complex scenarios even with hydrogen as a fuel. Nevertheless, the experimental set-up can be considered to be small-scale. Future large-scale data of this type will be valuable to confirm ability to predict large-scale accident scenarios.},

The present article reports partial results, focussing on defining the frequency of fires and explosions in offshore installations. Examples of the aforementioned procedures' application to a hypothetical floating, production, storage, and off-loading unit (FPSO) are presented. A framework for the quantitative risk assessment of fires and explosions requires the definition of both the frequency and consequences of such events. These procedures can be efficiently applied in offshore development projects, and the application includes the assessment of design explosion and fire loads as well as the quantification of effects of risk control options (RCO) such as platform layout, location and number of gas detectors, isolation of ignition sources etc.},

The technique aims to make easier and more systematic the process of learning from early warnings and identify atypical accident scenarios otherwise disregarded by common HAZID techniques. The comparison with a survey of the accident scenarios typically considered in available Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) studies evidences that DyPASI is a valuable tool to obtain a complete and updated overview of potential hazards in particular for new or innovative technologies, where limited operational experience is available.},

Tradi-tionally, these deformations have usually been avoided as they often represent a means of mechanical failure. However, a new trend has emerged in recent years in which buckling mechan-ics can be harnessed to endow materials with beneficial func-tions. For many such applications, it is desirable that such deformations happen reversibly and in response to well-defined signals or changes in their environment. While signifi-cant progress has been made on understanding and exploiting each type of deformation in its own right, here we focus on recent advances in the control and application of stimuli-responsive mechanical instabilities.},

The weak recycling method, rooted in scaling arguments on the canonical incompressible boundary layer, has been applied to supersonic boundary layer, rough surface boundary layer, and microscale urban canopy LES coupled with mesoscale numerical weather forecasting. Synthetic methods, originating from analytical approximation to homogeneous isotropic turbulence, have branched out into several robust methods, including the synthetic random Fourier method, synthetic digital filtering method, synthetic coherent eddy method, and synthetic volume forcing method. This article reviews major progress in inflow turbulence generation methods with an emphasis on fundamental ideas, key milestones, representative applications, and critical issues. Directions for future research in the field are also highlighted.},

abstract = {In the present paper heavy gas dispersion calculations were performed with OpenFoam. For a wind tunnel test case, numerical data was validated with experiments. For a full scale numerical experiment, a code to code comparison was performed with numerical results obtained from Fluent. The validation was performed in a gravity driven environment (slope), where the heavy gas induced the turbulence. For the code to code comparison, a hypothetical heavy gas release into a strongly turbulent atmospheric boundary layer including terrain effects was selected. The investigations were performed for SF6 and CO2 as heavy gases applying the standard k-e{\{}open{\}} turbulence model. A strong interaction of the heavy gas with the turbulence is present which results in a strong damping of the turbulence and therefore reduced heavy gas mixing. Especially this interaction, based on the buoyancy effects, was studied in order to ensure that the turbulence-buoyancy coupling is the main driver for the reduced mixing and not the global behaviour of the turbulence modelling.For both test cases, comparisons were performed between OpenFoam and Fluent solutions which were mainly in good agreement with each other. Beside steady state solutions, the time accuracy was investigated. In the low turbulence environment (wind tunnel test) which for both codes (laminar solutions) was in good agreement, also with the experimental data. The turbulent solutions of OpenFoam were in much better agreement with the experimental results than the Fluent solutions. Within the strong turbulence environment, both codes showed an excellent comparability. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The dynamic development of the LNG sector increases the risk of major accidents. Uncontrolled releases of LNG during the processes of manufacturing, distribution, storage, and regasification can pose a serious threat to people, facilities, and the environment. Therefore, an important goal is to determine hazard zones and the extent of potential consequences associated with a release of LNG. The key issue is to estimate these with the least level of uncertainty. The largest part of uncertainty comes from the modeling of LNG release sources and performing dispersion calculations. It is connected with the application of different mathematical models, the adoption of a number of simplifying assumptions, approximations, empirical relations, constants, and a lack of knowledge. This paper proposes a general procedure for calculating the release rate and duration time of the LNG release, pool spreading, vaporization, as well as dispersion, taking into consideration the uncertainty. The procedure consists of two parts. The first part concerns the sensitivity analysis to identify the most uncertain parameters of the LNG source term and dispersion models. The second part applies to two techniques used to include the uncertainty aspects of fuzzy sets and the Monte Carlo method for calculating hazard zones. In order to provide a basis for comparison between these two approaches, the shape of the membership functions used in the fuzzy methods are the same as the shape of the probability density function used in the Monte Carlo simulation. The case study, concerning an LNG release, illustrates the application of the proposed techniques.},

abstract = {Environmental risks are inherent in the operation of any complex chemical process industry. The indoor release of hazardous chemicals that are denser than air is a topic of special concern, since dense clouds tend to persist at ground level or human breath level which leads to a magnification of their harmful potential. In the present work, we propose a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based model for indoor risk assessment considering accidental release of a sustained, small, undetected leak of a dense toxic gas (chlorine) in an industrial indoor environment. Results from simulations show that the denser chlorine gas spreads like a liquid and flows all along the floor. At the same time, its concentration at a point away from the ground level increases slowly, thus showing that both stratification and dilution effects are present as the dense gas spreads. The implications of this spreading pattern from a risk assessment and risk mitigation point of view are discussed.},

In this paper, these new numerical techniques are extended to treat multiphase incompressible flow including the effects of viscosity, surface tension and gravity. While the most notable finite difference techniques for multiphase incompressible flow involve numerical smearing of the equations near the interface, see, e.g., [19, 17, 1], this new approach treats the interface in a sharp fashion.},

In addition to being used as microreactors ranging from the nano- to femtoliter range; droplet-based systems have also been used to directly synthesize particles and encapsulate many biological entities for biomedicine and biotechnology applications. This review will focus on the various droplet operations, as well as the numerous applications of the system. Due to advantages unique to droplet-based systems, this technology has the potential to provide novel solutions to today's biomedical engineering challenges for advanced diagnostics and therapeutics.},

abstract = {In the light of rapidly increasing applications of large-eddy simulations (LES), it is deemed necessary to impose some quality assessment measures for such studies. The verification of LES calculations is difficult because of the fact that both the subgrid scale (SGS) model contribution and numerical discretization errors are functions of the grid resolution. In this study, various indexes of quality measures, hereafter referred to as LES̱IQ, are proposed. The recommended LES̱IQ is based on the Richardson extrapolation concept. This method has been applied to various cases and the calculated LES̱IQ results are compared with the relative total experimental and direct numerical simulation (DNS) error, defined as IQ̱EX and IQ̱DNS, respectively. It is postulated that in practical applications of LES, numerical dissipation will always be a significant part of the overall dissipation, and it must be accounted for in any assessment of the quality of LES. It is further suggested that LES̱IQ of 75{\%} to 85{\%} can be considered adequate for most engineering applications that typically occur at high Reynolds numbers; the proposed index is an indicator of good resolution (i.e., verification), but not necessarily a good or accurate model (i.e., validation).},

abstract = {Although no LNG ship has experienced a loss of containment in over 40 years of shipping, it is important for risk management planning to understand the predicted consequences of a spill. A key parameter in assessing the impact of an LNG spill is the pool size. LNG spills onto water generally result in larger pools than land spills because they are unconfined. Modeling of LNG spills onto water is much more difficult than for land spills because the phenomena are more complex and the experimental basis is more limited. The most prevalent practice in predicting pool sizes is to treat the release as instantaneous or constant-rate, and to calculate the pool size using an empirical evaporation or burn rate. The evaporation or burn rate is particularly difficult to estimate for LNG spills on water, because the available data are so limited, scattered, and difficult to extrapolate to the large releases of interest. A more effective modeling of possible spills of LNG onto water calculates, rather than estimating, the evaporation or burn rate. The keys to this approach are to: * Use rigorous multicomponent physical properties. * Use a time-varying analysis of spill and evaporation. * Use a material and energy balance approach. * Estimate the heat transfer from water to LNG in a way that reflects the turbulence. These keys are explained and demonstrated by predictions of a model that incorporates these features. The major challenges are describing the effects of the LNG-water turbulence and the heat transfer from the pool fire to the underlying LNG pool. The model includes a fundamentally based framework for these terms, and the current formulation is based on some of the largest tests to-date. The heat transfer coefficient between the water and LNG is obtained by applying a "turbulence factor" to the value from correlations for quiescent film and transition boiling. The turbulence factor is based on two of the largest unignited tests on water to-date. The heat transfer from the fire to the pool is based on the burning rate for the largest pool fire test on land to-date.},

abstract = {The k–$\epsilon$ model is routinely used by wind engineers to computationally model the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). Commercial software is typically used, with the default law of the wall used to model the rough ground surface. By setting appropriate profiles for wind velocity and the turbulence quantities at the inlet, it is often assumed that the boundary layer will be maintained up to the buildings or obstructions in the flow. This paper shows that this is not the case, even in the absence of obstructions, and that the velocity and turbulence profiles decay along the fetch under these default conditions. By revisiting previous work, it is shown that the neutral ABL can be maintained along a lengthy fetch but only with a modified law of the wall and with a shear stress applied to the top boundary of the domain. For those practitioners who are not able to adopt this more thorough approach, some measures are suggested to mitigate the decay of the boundary layer.},

The standard kɛ model, although it has been successful for local scale problems especially in neutral conditions, is deficient for mesoscale flows without modifications. The k–ɛ model is re-examined and a new general approach in developing two-equation turbulence models is proposed with the aim of improving their reliability and consequently their range of applicability. This exercise has led to the replacement of the ɛ-transport equation by the transport equation for the turbulence inverse length scale (wavenumber). The present version of the model is restricted to neutrally stratified flows but applicable to both local scale and mesoscale flows. The model capabilities are demonstrated by application to a series of one-dimensional planetary boundary-layer problems and a two-dimensional flow over a square obstacle. For those applications, the present model gave considerably better results than the standard k–ɛ model.},

abstract = {The spillage of LNG on water surfaces can lead, under certain circumstances, to a decrease in the surface temperature of water and subsequent freezing. A model for heat transfer from water to LNG is proposed and used to calculate the surface temperature of water and examine its influence on the vaporization rate of LNG. For this purpose LNG was modeled based on the properties of pure methane. It was concluded that when LNG spills on a confined, shallow-water surface the surface temperature of water will decrease rapidly leading to ice formation. The formation of an ice layer, that will continue to grow for the duration of the spill, will have a profound effect upon the vaporization rate. The decreasing surface temperature of ice will decrease the temperature differential between LNG and ice that drives the heat transfer and will lead to a change of the boiling regime. The overall effect would be that the vaporization flux would first decrease during the film boiling; followed by an increase during the transition boiling and a steady decrease during the nucleate boiling.},

Advantage is taken from new, non-intrusive optical measurement techniques (e.g. image correlation velocimetry, ICV, and background oriented Schlieren, BOS) providing detailed pictures of the temperature and velocity field in relevant regions of the cloud. The ice particles in the cloud, formed by nucleation, represent a natural seeding to be used as tracers, which have the advantage of behaving passively. Two layers can be identified in a cryogenic gas cloud: a lower cold layer, which is visible due to the presence of ice particles, and an invisible upper layer, where the ice particles have melted, mostly due to heat addition by air entrainment into the upper layer. A two-layer model has been applied to a generic element of the cloud, where detailed experimental data regarding velocity and temperature are available. Thermal- and dilution behaviour can be interpreted by means of the model which is presented in detail. A global entrainment parameter is deduced allowing a simple comparison with existing experimental information obtained by other traditional experimental techniques. The numerical values of the present entrainment parameter agree well with the correlations proposed by other authors. Thermal effects, such as heat transfer from the ground, appear to be very important. In addition, the visible height of the cloud can be predicted in relative good agreement with the experimental observations, by means of a thermal balance including the phase transition of the ice particles.},

abstract = {A micron-resolution particle image velocimetry (micro-PIV) system has been developed to measure instantaneous and ensemble-averaged flow fields in micron-scale fluidic devices. The system utilizes an epifluorescent microscope, 100-300 nm diameter seed particles, and an intensified CCD camera to record high-resolution particle-image fields. Velocity vector fields can be measured with spatial resolutions down to 6.9 x 6.9 x 1.5 mu m. The vector fields are analyzed using a double-frame cross-correlation algorithm. In this technique, the spatial resolution and the accuracy of the velocity measurements is limited by the diffraction limit of the recording optics, noise in the particle image field, and the interaction of the fluid with the finite-sized seed particles. The stochastic influence of Brownian motion plays a significant role in the accuracy of instantaneous velocity measurements. The micro-PIV technique is applied to measure velocities in a Hele-Shaw flow around a 30 mu m (major diameter) elliptical cylinder, with a bulk velocity of approximately 50 mu m s(-1).},

abstract = {Air quality models help in developing relationships between the amount of pollutant released into the ambient atmosphere by a source and the corresponding incremental contribution in the atmospheric concentration. Of the various dispersion models, the heavy gas models help in predicting the concentrations due to release of gases heavier than air and the risks associated with the increased concentrations. Several differences exist among the various models developed to study the heavy-gas dispersion phenomena. These differences mainly arise because of the varied treatment given to physical processes involved in the dispersion mechanism. One of these processes, which have not been fully considered in many of the existing models, is the effect of ground heating on the movement of a cloud under windy conditions. In this study, the box model developed by Kunsch and Fannelop [J. Hazard. Mater. 43 (1995) 169] is extended to incorporate variable air entrainment on the dispersion of a heavy gas cloud spreading in a channel under windy conditions. The air entrainment was assumed to be proportional to the cloud frontal velocity. The semi-analytical equations developed were then solved by numerical methods to provide a heavy gas cloud dispersion profile. The popular Runge-Kutta fourth order technique was adopted to solve the differential equations numerically. The model was applied on a cold cloud released instantaneously and the results indicated that the model behavior follows closely the expected dispersion trends and observed cloud characteristics reported in a laboratory study. The trial run carried out in order to model the scenario of no heat transfer, by equating the source temperature to the ambient temperature, followed variations observed in the field. The analysis of cloud behavior indicated that the cloud length is strongly influenced by source density and initial cloud temperature.},

abstract = {Surface transportation of carbon dioxide will be a critical issue in the developing field of carbon capture and storage (CCS). A leak from a high-pressure transportation facility can result in damage to the environment and hazard to people, depending on the total amount of carbon dioxide released to the atmosphere and the concentrations achieved in the proximity of the leakage. Generic Risk Assessments for CO2 transportation to date have relied on various assumptions about the behaviour of carbon dioxide after a severe pressure drop. In this study, simulations by two classes of atmospheric dispersion model (Gaussian and computational fluid dynamics, CFD) have been compared, taking representative input parameters concerning high-pressure CO2 releases from the literature. The CFD model was used to simulate a high-speed release with specified velocities with the aim of evaluating the effect of initial gas dispersion on the downwind length reached by toxic concentrations of the pollutant. Results of this investigation depict a lowering of the Risk involved in the transportation of CO2 by up to one order of magnitude, when modelling the same releases with a CFD tool, compared to the more widespread Gaussian models. The EU used results from Gaussian modelling for drawing up an Impact Assessment on the CO2 transportation within CCS. In this paper, suggestions for future preparation of CCS Risk Assessments are presented.},

abstract = {Atmospheric stability classification is required to quantify the dispersion capabilities of the ambient atmosphere (i.e. the dispersion coefficients or the standard deviation of concentration distribution in lateral and vertical directions, $\sigma$y and $\sigma$z, respectively) in the air quality models for concentration predictions. Several different types of stability classification schemes are given depending on the availability of meteorological parameters and the related atmospheric processes in the lower part of the boundary layer. In the present study, atmospheric stabilities are estimated from seven different stability classification schemes based on Monin–Obukhov length, bulk and gradient Richardson numbers, temperature gradient, wind speed ratio, etc. The estimated stabilities are compared with the Pasquill stability classification which is very widely used and requires only routine data. The spread of stabilities in each scheme is large and sometimes it covers the entire range of stabilities for a given Pasquill class. However, it has been observed that the schemes based on Monin–Obukhov length and Richardson number gives reasonable comparison than the rest of the schemes. The performance of each of these schemes has been discussed based on the underlying physics. The study demonstrates that for a complete and exhaustive data set such as Kincaid, there exists a wide variations among all atmospheric stabilities with Pasquill and one another in a manner such that an entire range of stabilities may be obtained for a given Pasquill class. The implications of this on estimated distance to maximum ground level concentrations are great and could affect the overall outcome of conventional Gaussian models for industrial siting, planning and management.},

The impact of the release process is investigated on the overall heavy gas dispersion. The study focuses on the importance of an accurate source term modeling by means of the numerical rebuilding of experimental data from wind tunnel and full scale; a representative 2-phase release model with low numerical effort is developed. Different full scale CO2 pipeline rupture release scenarios are simulated including a representative terrain topology. Wind conditions and shut-in valve distances are varied resulting in a strong interaction of the released heavy gas with the turbulence of the atmospheric boundary layer but also the terrain topology. Based on these results it can be stated that effect distances are locally increased drastically, also with respect to their temporal behavior.},

abstract = {Effective safety measures to prevent and mitigate the consequences of an accidental release of flammable LNG are critical. Water spray curtain is currently recognized as an effective technique to control and mitigate various hazards in the industries. It has been used to absorb, dilute and disperse both toxic and flammable vapor cloud. It is also used as protection against heat radiation, in case of fighting vapor cloud fire. Water curtain has also been considered as one of the most economic and promising LNG vapor cloud control techniques. Water curtains are expected to enhance LNG vapor cloud dispersion mainly through mechanical effects, dilution, and thermal effects. The actual phenomena involved in LNG vapor and water curtain interaction were not clearly established from previous research. LNG spill experiments have been performed at the Brayton Fire Training Field at Texas A{\&}M University (TAMU) to understand the effect of water curtain in controlling and dispersing LNG vapor cloud. This paper summarizes experimental methodology and presents data from two water curtain tests. The analysis of the test results are also presented to identify the effectiveness of these two types of water spray curtains in enhancing the LNG vapor cloud dispersion.},

abstract = {Concerns over public safety and security of a potential liquefied natural gas (LNG) spill have promoted the need for continued improvement of safety measures for LNG facilities. The mitigation techniques have been recognized as one of the areas that require further investigation to determine the public safety impact of an LNG spill. Forced mitigation of LNG vapors using a water curtain system has been proven to be effective in reducing the vapor concentration by enhancing the dispersion. Currently, no engineering criteria for designing an effective water curtain system are available, mainly due to a lack of understanding of the complex droplet–vapor interaction. This work applies computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling to evaluate various key design parameters involved in the LNG forced mitigation using an upwards-oriented full-cone water spray. An LNG forced dispersion model based on a Eulerian–Lagrangian approach was applied to solve the physical interactions of the droplet–vapor system by taking into account the various effects of the droplets (discrete phase) on the air–vapor mixture (continuous phase). The effects of different droplet sizes, droplet temperatures, air entrainment rates, and installation configurations of water spray applications on LNG vapor behavior are investigated. Finally, the potential of applying CFD modeling in providing guidance for setting up the design criteria for an effective forced mitigation system as an integrated safety element for LNG facilities is discussed.},

@article{Lenormand1995,
abstract = {Large-scale dispersion in heterogeneous porous media is studied by using a simple model based on stochastic calculation of convective flow in a bundle of stream tubes. The advantage of this approach is that there is a local relationship between velocity and permeability in the 1-dimensional space of the stream tubes. Dispersion is due to the variation in stream tube cross-section, related to the permeability field. First, the arrival times of the tracer in the stream tubes are related to the stochastic properties of the permeability field (variance and covariance). Then, transport equations are derived from the moments of the arrival times. The results agree with more complicated studies. For a permeability field with long-range correlation, the transport equation is not unique. It depends on the assumptions involving moments higher than two. Assuming a Gaussian shape for the tracer flux leads to equations similar to the ones obtained in previous studies of time-dependent dispersivity. Without this approximation, the equation is non-local (integrodifferential) and leads to a memory effect. In the last part of this paper, the general results are illustrated with several correlation functions for the permeability field: purely random, exponential and power law covariance, and perfectly layered media.},

Provided is a broad overview of the different areas to which numerical techniques have been applied in the development of these devices from detailed studies of fundamental microfluidic problems (e.g., species mixing and sample dispersion) to unique approaches that take a more global overview of the entire system. While the majority of the work to date has been in these areas, also reviewed is some recent progress into other equally important areas of microscale transport such as thermal analysis and chemical reactivity and specificity. An overview of the advantages and disadvantages of common numerical techniques is also presented along with a brief discussion of some of the existing numerical tools, focusing on those best suited for microscale transport analysis. As microfluidic devices become increasingly complex, optimal fluidic and transport designs become more and more difficult to do experimentally. Thus, it is believed that future demand in the field will be for highly integrated simulation tools that allow users without a significant computational fluids background to ``numerical prototype'' highly integrated devices.},

abstract = {This paper reports the evaluation of dispersion models with respect to their ability to predict the dispersion of continuous dense gas plumes over flat terrain. The exercise has been carried out in order to derive guidelines for statistical model evaluation exercises. Therefore, the models selected for the evaluation are simple: the Britter and McQuaid model and three variations of the Gaussian Plume Model. Two different evaluation procedures have been used: one using short time-averaged concentrations paired in time and space and another using observed maximum concentrations at certain distances together with a measure of the plume width. The performance numbers and ranking of the models depend substantially on the data sets used and the evaluation procedure and performance number selected. The two evaluation procedures have both advantages and disadvantages. An evaluation based on maximum concentration should not be performed without taking into account the plume dimensions. The evaluation using data paired in time and space suffers from the inability of the models and the data analysis techniques to match the predicted plume path with the actual plume path during the experiment. We suggest that two newly defined performance measures be used, the Mean Relative Bias and the Mean Relative Square Error, together with the well-known ‘Factor-of-2' statistic in future statistical evaluation exercises. One should use at least two performance measures in an evaluation exercise in order to obtain a measure of ‘bias' and ‘variance'. Furthermore, we advise that graphical presentations to obtain an understanding of the model behaviour be used.},

@article{McKee2007,
abstract = {AbstractWe review current understanding of star formation, outlining an overall theoretical framework and the observations that motivate it. A conception of star formation has emerged in which turbulence plays a dual role, both creating overdensities to initiate gravitational contraction or collapse, and countering the effects of gravity in these overdense regions. The key dynamical processes involved in star formation?turbulence, magnetic fields, and self-gravity?are highly nonlinear and multidimensional. Physical arguments are used to identify and explain the features and scalings involved in star formation, and results from numerical simulations are used to quantify these effects. We divide star formation into large-scale and small-scale regimes and review each in turn. Large scales range from galaxies to giant molecular clouds (GMCs) and their substructures. Important problems include how GMCs form and evolve, what determines the star formation rate (SFR), and what determines the initial mass function (IMF). Small scales range from dense cores to the protostellar systems they beget. We discuss formation of both low- and high-mass stars, including ongoing accretion. The development of winds and outflows is increasingly well understood, as are the mechanisms governing angular momentum transport in disks. Although outstanding questions remain, the framework is now in place to build a comprehensive theory of star formation that will be tested by the next generation of telescopes.},

abstract = {During the period from 1977 to 1989, the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) conducted a liquefied gaseous fuels spill effects program under the sponsorship of the US Department of Energy, Department of Transportation, Gas Research Institute and others. The goal of this program was to develop and validate tools that could be used to predict the effects of a large liquefied gas spill through the execution of large scale field experiments and the development of computer models to make predictions for conditions under which tests could not be performed. Over the course of the program, three series of LNG spill experiments were performed to study cloud formation, dispersion, combustion and rapid phase transition (RPT) explosions. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of this program, the lessons learned from 12 years of research as well as some recommendations for the future. The general conclusion from this program is that cold, dense gas related phenomena can dominate the dispersion of a large volume, high release rate spill of LNG especially under low ambient wind speed and stable atmospheric conditions, and therefore, it is necessary to include a detailed and validated description of these phenomena in computer models to adequately predict the consequences of a release. Specific conclusions include:•LNG vapor clouds are lower and wider than trace gas clouds and tend to follow the downhill slope of terrain due to dampened vertical turbulence and gravity flow within the cloud. Under low wind speed, stable atmospheric conditions, a bifurcated, two lobed structure develops.•Navier–Stokes models provide the most complete description of LNG dispersion, while more highly parameterized Lagrangian models were found to be well suited to emergency response applications.•The measured heat flux from LNG vapor cloud burns exceeded levels necessary for third degree burns and were large enough to ignite most flammable materials.•RPTs are of two types, source generated and enrichment generated, and were observed to increase the burn area by a factor of two and to extend the downwind burn distance by 65{\%}. Additional large scale experiments and model development are recommended.},

The new eddy viscosity formulation is based on the realizability constraints; the positivity of normal Reynolds stresses and the Schwarz' inequality for turbulent shear stresses. We find that the present model with a set of unified model coefficients can perform well for a variety of flows. The flows that are examined include: (i) rotating homogeneous shear flows; (ii) boundary-free shear flows including a mixing layer, planar and round jets; (iii) a channel flow, and flat plate boundary layers with and without a pressure gradient; and (iv) backward facing step separated flows. The model predictions are compared with available experimental data. The results from the standard k-ϵ eddy viscosity model are also included for comparison. It is shown that the present model is a significant improvement over the standard k-ϵ eddy viscosity model.},

abstract = {The scope of the present study is to try to determine a comprehensive heat transfer formulation, which would be able to predict adequately the heat transfer mechanism on a wide range of different reciprocating engine configurations (spark-ignition and diesel engines) and operating conditions. To this aim, four of the most popular heat transfer formulations used in commercial and research CFD (computational fluid dynamics) codes are evaluated comparatively against available experimental data, using an in-house CFD model that has already been applied satisfactorily for the simulation of a spark-ignition and a diesel engine running under motoring conditions. The comparison reveals that most of the existing wall heat transfer formulations fail to predict adequately both the history and peak value of the heat flux. Nonetheless, the predicted trends of the heat flux during the entire closed part of the engine cycle are similar, with higher differences occurring during the expansion phase. To overcome this, the present authors proceeded to the development of a new wall heat transfer formulation based on the existing ones. This new formulation is used in the in-house CFD model for the simulation of the heat transfer through the cylinder walls for the same engines and operating conditions as those used for the comparative evaluation of the existing heat transfer models. Comparing the calculated heat flux using the five heat transfer models with the corresponding measured one, it is concluded that in most cases the new model predicts more accurately the heat transfer during the compression stroke for motored operation and at the same time the predicted peak heat flux is closer to the experimental one. Although a more fundamental formulation is used to describe the heat transfer process, the computational time required is not affected, which is a parameter crucial for multi-dimensional modeling.},

abstract = {Recent discussions on the fate of LNG spills into impoundments have suggested that the commonly used combination of SOURCE5 and DEGADIS to predict the flammable vapor dispersion distances is not accurate, as it does not account for vapor entrainment by wind. SOURCE5 assumes the vapor layer to grow upward uniformly in the form of a quiescent saturated gas cloud that ultimately spills over impoundment walls. The rate of spillage is then used as the source term for DEGADIS. A more rigorous approach to predict the flammable vapor dispersion distance is to use a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. CFD codes can take into account the physical phenomena that govern the fate of LNG spills into impoundments, such as the mixing between air and the evaporated gas. Before a CFD code can be proposed as an alternate method for the prediction of flammable vapor cloud distances, it has to be validated with proper experimental data. This paper describes the use of Fluent, a widely-used commercial CFD code, to simulate one of the tests in the "Falcon" series of LNG spill tests. The "Falcon" test series was the only series that specifically addressed the effects of impoundment walls and construction obstructions on the behavior and dispersion of the vapor cloud. Most other tests, such as the Coyote and the Burro series, involved spills onto water and relatively flat ground. The paper discusses the critical parameters necessary for a CFD model to accurately predict the behavior of a cryogenic spill in a geometrically complex domain, and presents comparisons between the gas concentrations measured during the Falcon-1 test and those predicted using Fluent. Finally, the paper discusses the effect vapor barriers have in containing part of the spill thereby shortening the ignitable vapor cloud and therefore the required hazard area. This issue was addressed by comparing the Falcon-1 simulation (spill into the impoundment) with the simulation of an identical spill without any impoundment walls, or obstacles within the impoundment area.},

abstract = {The effectiveness of the application of CFD to vapour cloud explosion (VCE) modelling depends on the accuracy with which geometrical details of the obstacles likely to be encountered by the vapour cloud are represented and the correctness with which turbulence is predicted. This is because the severity of a VCE strongly depends on the types of obstacles encountered by the cloud undergoing combustion; the turbulence generated by the obstacles influences flame speed and feeds the process of explosion through enhanced mixing of fuel and oxidant. In this paper a CFD-based method is proposed on the basis of the author's finding that among the various models available for assessing turbulence, the realizable k–ɛ model yields results closer to experimental findings than the other, more frequently used, turbulence models if used in conjunction with the eddy-dissipation model. The applicability of the method has been demonstrated in simulating the dispersion and ignition of a typical vapour cloud formed as a result of a spill from a liquid petroleum gas (LPG) tank situated in a refinery. The simulation made it possible to assess the overpressures resulting from the combustion of the flammable vapour cloud. The phenomenon of flame acceleration, which is a characteristic of combustion enhanced in the presence of obstacles, was clearly observed. Comparison of the results with an oft-used commercial software reveals that the present CFD-based method achieves a more realistic simulation of the VCE phenomena.},

abstract = {This article discusses Code Verification of Reynolds-Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) solvers that rely on face based finite volume discretizations for volumes of arbitrary shape. The study includes test cases with known analytical solutions (generated with the method of manufactured solutions) corresponding to laminar and turbulent flow, with the latter using eddy-viscosity turbulence models. The procedure to perform Code Verification based on grid refinement studies is discussed and the requirements for its correct application are illustrated in a simple one-dimensional problem. It is shown that geometrically similar grids are recommended for proper Code Verification and so the data should not have scatter making the use of least square fits unnecessary. Results show that it may be advantageous to determine the extrapolated error to cell size/time step zero instead of assuming that it is zero, especially when it is hard to determine the asymptotic order of grid convergence. In the RANS examples, several of the features of the ReFRESCO solver are checked including the effects of the available turbulence models in the convergence properties of the code. It is shown that it is required to account for non-orthogonality effects in the discretization of the diffusion terms and that the turbulence quantities transport equations can deteriorate the order of grid convergence of mean flow quantities.},

abstract = {Some new developments of explicit algebraic Reynolds stress turbulence models (EARSM) are presented. The new developments include a new near-wall treatment ensuring realizability for the individual stress components, a formulation for compressible flows, and a suggestion for a possible approximation of diffusion terms in the anisotropy transport equation. Recent developments in this area are assessed and collected into a model for both incompressible and compressible three-dimensional wall-bounded turbulent flows. This model represents a solution of the implicit ARSM equations, where the production to dissipation ratio is obtained as a solution to a nonlinear algebraic relation. Three-dimensionality is fully accounted for in the mean flow description of the stress anisotropy. The resulting EARSM has been found to be well suited to integration to the wall and all individual Reynolds stresses can be well predicted by introducing wall damping functions derived from the van Driest damping function. The platform for the model consists of the transport equations for the kinetic energy and an auxiliary quantity. The proposed model can be used with any such platform, and examples are shown for two different choices of the auxiliary quantity.},

abstract = {Mitigation techniques for liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities require further investigation to minimize the uncertainty in determining the impact and consequence of an LNG spill on public safety and security. Water curtain systems have been proven to reduce the hazard zone by diluting the vapor concentration below the flammability limits when directly applied to LNG vapors. Currently, no definitive engineering criteria for designing effective water curtains applicable to LNG facilities are available, mainly due to a lack of understanding of the complex interaction between the droplets and LNG vapor. This work applies LNG forced dispersion modeling to study the physical mechanisms involved in enhancing vapor dispersion. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes have been utilized to examine the effects of momentum imparting from the droplets to the air–vapor mixture, the thermal transfer between the two phases (droplet/vapor), and various air entrainment rates on the behavior of the LNG vapor.

abstract = {In 2006, the Health and Safety Laboratory (HSL) undertook a research project to develop tools for the National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA) Liquefied Natural Gas Technical Committee to evaluate liquefied natural gas (LNG) dispersion models. The work was commissioned by the Fire Protection Research Foundation (FPRF) and delivered a Model Evaluation Protocol (Ivings et al., 2007) which included a checklist of model evaluation criteria and a structure for complete model evaluation. A partial evaluation of some common current dispersion models was also carried out. Subsequently, FPRF let a subcontract to HSL to create a database of full scale experimental trials and wind tunnels tests which can be used to validate LNG dispersion models. This work has recently been completed. The current project is concerned with the assessment of source term models for LNG spills that are used to provide an input to the LNG dispersion models. This work has been jointly funded by the UK Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and FPRF and aims to provide a state-of-the-art review of source term models which predict the early development of a release of LNG and an approach for assessing the adequacy of such models. This report and the work it describes were jointly funded by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and the Fire Protection Research Foundation (FPRF).

Since then, the concept of reliability has become a pervasive attribute worth of both qualitative and quantitative connotations. In particular, the revolutionary social, cultural and technological changes that have occurred from the 1800s to the 2000s have contributed to the need for a rational framework and quantitative treatment of the reliability of engineered systems and plants. This has led to the rise of reliability engineering as a scientific discipline. In this paper, some considerations are shared with respect to a number of problems and challenges which researchers and practitioners in reliability engineering are facing when analyzing today's complex systems. The focus will be on the contribution of reliability to system safety and on its role within system risk analysis.},

abstract = {An accurate description of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) is a prerequisite for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) wind studies. This includes taking into account the thermal stability of the atmosphere, which can be stable, neutral or unstable, depending on the nature of the surface fluxes of momentum and heat. The surface fluxes and vertical profiles of wind velocity and temperature are described by Monin–Obukhov similarity theory. The implementation of this thermally stratified atmosphere into CFD has been examined in this study by using Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) turbulence models, and the commercial code STAR-CCM+. The maintenance of the temperature, velocity and turbulence profiles along an extensive computational domain length was required, while simultaneously allowing for full variation in pressure and density through the ideal gas law. Effects of gravity and buoyancy were included, leading to the emergence of the hydrostatic pressure field and the resultant density changes expected in the real atmosphere. The CFD model was tested against measured data, from the literature, for the flow over a cosine hill in a wind tunnel. The standard k?$\epsilon$ and SST k?$\omega$ turbulence models represented the data most accurately. The flow over an idealised transverse dune immersed in the thermally stratified ABL was also investigated. It was found that the flow recovery was enhanced and re- attachment occurred earlier in unstable conditions, while flow recovery and re-attachment took longer in stable conditions. The effect of the dune on the flow higher up in the atmosphere was also felt at much higher distances for unstable conditions, through enhanced vertical velocities. Under stable conditions vertical velocities were reduced. This confirmed that the assumption of neutral conditions could lead to an incomplete picture of the flow conditions that influence any particular case of interest.},

@article{Hu2010,
abstract = {Abstract Accurate depiction of meteorological conditions, especially within the planetary boundary layer (PBL), is important for air pollution modeling, and PBL parameterization schemes play a critical role in simulating the boundary layer. This study examines the sensitivity of the performance of the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model to the use of three different PBL schemes [Mellor?Yamada?Janjic (MYJ), Yonsei University (YSU), and the asymmetric convective model, version 2 (ACM2)]. Comparison of surface and boundary layer observations with 92 sets of daily, 36-h high-resolution WRF simulations with different schemes over Texas in July?September 2005 shows that the simulations with the YSU and ACM2 schemes give much less bias than with the MYJ scheme. Simulations with the MYJ scheme, the only local closure scheme of the three, produced the coldest and moistest biases in the PBL. The differences among the schemes are found to be due predominantly to differences in vertical mixing strength and entrainment of air from above the PBL. A sensitivity experiment with the ACM2 scheme confirms this diagnosis.},

@article{Vinnem2010a,
abstract = {Planning of hazardous facilities is usually carried out on the basis of a risk-informed decision-making and planning process making use of risk analysis. This practice is well established in Norway under petroleum legislation but less so for onshore facilities under non-petroleum legislation. The present paper focuses on the use of risk analysis studies for risk evaluation against risk acceptance criteria, risk communication and derivation of technical and operational requirements in these circumstances. This is demonstrated through reference to a case study involving an LNG plant currently under construction in an urban area in Norway. The main finding is that risk-informed legislation is a fragile legislative system which is dependent on conscientious and open-minded use by the industrial developer. In the opposite case, the authorities may well be unable to correct the situation and the legislation may fail to protect the neighbourhood from unreasonable exposure to risk. Reference is also made to the international perspective where authorities define what is deemed tolerable risk, which would appear to be a more robust and defensible approach.},

abstract = {Transient experiments with liquefied binary mixtures of methane-ethane and methane-propane boiling on water, show great differences in the boiling characteristics compared to pure methane. The high initial boil-off rates observed in some of the experiments, are believed to occur due to breakdown of film boiling while the water surface has a higher temperature than the superheat limit of the cryogenic liquid. The high initial boil-off rates were most profound in the methane-rich mixtures, comparable to commercial liquefied natural gas (LNG). These findings may have significance to the way heat transfer is implemented in the models describing rapid phase transitions (RPT) in the LNG-water system.},

abstract = {Abstract A small-scale experimental study was conducted using liquid nitrogen to investigate the convective heat transfer behavior of cryogenic liquids released on water. The experiment was performed by spilling five different amounts of liquid nitrogen at different release rates and initial water temperatures. The vaporization mass fluxes of liquid nitrogen were determined directly from the mass loss measured during the experiment. A variation of initial vaporization fluxes and a subsequent shift in heat transfer mechanism were observed with changes in initial water temperature. The initial vaporization fluxes were directly dependent on the liquid nitrogen spill rate. The heat flux from water to liquid nitrogen determined from experimental data was validated with two theoretical correlations for convective boiling. It was also observed from validation with correlations that liquid nitrogen was found to be predominantly in the film boiling regime. The substantial results provide a suitable procedure for predicting the heat flux from water to cryogenic liquids that is required for source term modeling.},

A preliminary risk analysis for LNG ships approaching the Panigaglia terminal is carried out: based on literature data and on the characteristics of the location, a spill originated from a sea accident can be excluded; on the contrary, intentional damages may cause the release of a large amount of LNG, giving rise to a pool fire. Consequence analysis shows that dangerous thermal effects are expected within a radius of 700–1500m; in the location under exam, the impact on resident population will be negligible, for the most probable attack site, and marginal for an occasionally used anchorage, which should be no longer allowed.},

Particular attention is given to the approximation of the pressure-strain correlations; the forms adopted appear to give reasonably satisfactory partitioning of the stresses both near walls and in free shear flows.Numerical solutions of the model equations are presented for a selection of strained homogeneous shear flows and for two-dimensional inhomogeneous shear flows including the jet, the wake, the mixing layer and plane channel flow. In addition, it is shown that the closure does predict a very strong influence of secondary strain terms for flow over curved surfaces.},

abstract = {A new equation of state for the thermodynamic properties of natural gases, similar gases, and other mixtures, the GERG-2008 equation of state, is presented in this work. This equation is an expanded version of the GERG-2004 equation. GERG-2008 is explicit in the Helmholtz free energy as a function of density, temperature, and composition. The equation is based on 21 natural gas components: methane, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, ethane, propane, n-butane, isobutane, n-pentane, isopentane, n-hexane, n-heptane, n-octane, n-nonane, n-decane, hydrogen, oxygen, carbon monoxide, water, hydrogen sulfide, helium, and argon. Over the entire composition range, GERG-2008 covers the gas phase, liquid phase, supercritical region, and vapor–liquid equilibrium states for mixtures of these components. The normal range of validity of GERG-2008 includes temperatures from (90 to 450) K and pressures up to 35 MPa where the most accurate experimental data of the thermal and caloric properties are represented to within their accuracy. The extended validity range reaches from (60 to 700) K and up to 70 MPa. The given numerical information (including all of the sophisticated derivatives) enables the use of GERG-2008 for all of the various technical applications. Examples are processing, transportation through pipelines or by shipping, storage and liquefaction of natural gas, and processes to separate gas components. Comparisons with other equations of state, for example, AGA8-DC92 and Peng–Robinson equation (P-R), are also presented. GERG-2008 will be adopted as an ISO Standard (ISO 20765-2/3) for natural gases.},

abstract = {A review of the standard model of LNG pool spreading on water, comparing it with the model and experiments on oil pool spread from which the LNG model is extrapolated, raises questions about the validity of the former as applied to spills from marine tankers. These questions arise from the difference in fluid density ratios, in the multi-dimensional flow at the pool edge, in the effects of LNG pool boiling at the LNG-water interface, and in the model and experimental initial conditions compared with the inflow conditions from a marine tanker spill. An alternate supercritical flow model is proposed that avoids these difficulties; it predicts significant increase in the maximum pool radius compared with the standard model and is partially corroborated by tests of LNG pool fires on water. Wind driven ocean wave interaction has little effect on either spread model.},

abstract = {The application of CFD (computational fluid dynamics) using RANS (Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations) model to turbulent flows with mass transfer generally estimates the turbulent scalar flux assuming the gradient diffusion hypothesis, which requires definition of the turbulent Schmidt number, Sct However, no universal value of Sct has been established and empirical values have been used in different studies. In this paper, previous research related to the application of optimum values of Sct for engineering flowfields relevant to atmospheric dispersion is reviewed. The optimum values for Sct are widely distributed in the range of 0.2–1.3 and the specific value selected has a significant effect on the prediction results. On the basis of the present study results and since the optimum values of Sct largely depend on the local flow characteristics, it is recommended that Sct should be determined by considering the dominant flow structure in each case.},

abstract = {This paper deals with the computational simulation of atmospheric cloud dispersion resulting from liquefied gas spills. Experimental data were taken from the Coyote series trials that involved large scale cryogenic natural gas releases. The data were used for checking the validity of the results obtained through the computational fluid dynamics code CFX. Moreover, using the experimental data-set of the non-isothermal gas dispersion, a comparative evaluation was performed between the code and two popular box-models (SLAB and DEGADIS) on the basis of specific statistical performance measures. The results showed that CFX approximated gas concentration histories with a reasonably good agreement and predicted correctly the behavior of gas cloud during dispersion. In particular, it predicted that the cryogenic dense cloud produced by the flash boiling would disperse as a heavy rather than a light gas, although the natural gas is lighter than air at normal conditions. On the other hand, the statistical treatment revealed that box-models may also give acceptable results even for the complex case of non-isothermal gas dispersion. Nevertheless, the CFX code unambiguously demonstrated considerably better accuracy.},

abstract = {Abstract This paper, first of a two-part work, presents an overview of the development of a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solver in OpenFOAM platform to simulate the internal ventilation regime within an open pit including the effects of developed turbulence, buoyancy and stratification. To incorporate the effect of stratification in the simulations we have chosen a formulation that includes density as a variable in the system of equations, thus facilitating further study of buoyant flows. Given the importance of turbulence in this type of large-scale flows we have used Large Eddy Simulation (LES) to incorporate it in the calculation, using a Detached Eddy Simulation (DES) approach to solve the flow near walls. Specific initial and boundary conditions were defined. The results presented in this paper, including several tests of the solver where we compared our results with experimental or numerical data, have demonstrated the validity of using OpenFOAM to study this type of complex multiphysics problems. Especially advantageous in this regard are the flexibility provided by the modular structure of the code, the possibility of defining specific boundary and initial conditions for each case, and the ability of generating detailed meshes of complex geometries. Also we probed the benefits of using a DES approach, allowing us to solve developed turbulence and the interaction of the flow with detailed geometry. A second paper associated to this work will expose the application of the solver to large open pit mines, simulating the particular case of Chuquicamata, one of the largest open pit mines in the world, located in northern Chile.},

abstract = {Ventilation is frequently used as a means for preventing the build up of flammable or toxic gases in enclosed spaces. The effectiveness of the ventilation often has to be considered as part of a safety case or risk assessment. In this paper methods for assessing ventilation effectiveness for hazardous area classification are examined. The analysis uses data produced from Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations of low-pressure jet releases of flammable gas in a ventilated enclosure. The CFD model is validated against experimental measurements of gas releases in a ventilation-controlled test chamber. Good agreement is found between the model predictions and the experimental data. Analysis of the CFD results shows that the flammable gas cloud volume resulting from a leak is largely dependent on the mass release rate of flammable gas and the ventilation rate of the enclosure. The effectiveness of the ventilation for preventing the build up of flammable gas can therefore be assessed by considering the average gas concentration at the enclosure outlet(s). It is found that the ventilation rate of the enclosure provides a more useful measure of ventilation effectiveness than considering the enclosure air change rate.},

abstract = {A theoretical foundation for two widely used statistical representations of multiphase flows, namely the Eulerian–Eulerian (EE) and Lagrangian–Eulerian (LE) representations, is established in the framework of the probability density function (p.d.f.) formalism. Consistency relationships between fundamental statistical quantities in the EE and LE representations are rigorously established. It is shown that fundamental quantities in the two statistical representations bear an exact relationship to each other only under conditions of spatial homogeneity. Transport equations for the probability densities in each statistical representation are derived. Exact governing equations for the mean mass, mean momentum and second moment of velocity corresponding to the two statistical representations are derived from these transport equations. In particular, for the EE representation, the p.d.f. formalism is shown to naturally lead to the widely used ensemble-averaged equations for two-phase flows. Galilean-invariant combinations of unclosed terms in the governing equations that need to be modelled are clearly identified. The correspondence between unclosed terms in each statistical representation is established. Hybrid EE–LE computations can benefit from this correspondence, which serves in consistently transferring information from one representation to the other. Advantages and limitations of each statistical representation are identified. The results of this work can also serve as a guiding framework for direct numerical simulations of two-phase flows, which can now be exploited to precisely quantify unclosed terms in the governing equations in the two statistical representations.},

@article{Raj2010,
abstract = {One of the scenarios of concern in assessing the safety issues related to transportation of LNG in a marine environment (ship or underwater pipeline) is the release of LNG underwater. This scenario has not been given the same level of scientific attention in the literature compared to surface releases and assessment of consequences therefrom. This paper addresses questions like, (1) does an LNG spill underwater form a pool on the water surface and subsequently evaporate like an LNG spill “on the surface” producing cold, heavier than air vapors?, and (2) what is the range of expected temperatures of the vapor, generated by LNG release due to heat transfer within the water column, when it emanates from the water surface? Very limited data from two field tests of LNG underwater release are reviewed. Also presented are the results from tests conducted in other related industries (metal casting, nuclear fission and fusion, chemical processing, and alternative fuel vehicles) where a hot (or cold) liquid is injected into a bulk cold (or hot) liquid at different depths. A mathematical model is described which calculates the temperature of vapor emanating at the water surface, and the liquid fraction of released LNG that surfaces, if any, to form a pool on the water surface. The model includes such variables as the LNG release rate, diameter of the jet at release, depth of release and water body temperature. Results obtained from the model for postulated release conditions are presented. Comparison of predicted results with available LNG underwater release test data is also provided.},

abstract = {An underwater LNG release test was conducted to understand the phenomena that occur when LNG is released underwater and to determine the characteristic of the vapor emanating from the water surface. Another objective of the test was to determine if an LNG liquid pool formed on the water surface, spread and evaporated in a manner similar to that from an on-the-surface release of LNG. A pit of dimensions 10.06 m × 6.4 m and 1.22 m depth filled with water to 1.14 m depth was used. A vertically upward shooting LNG jet was released from a pipe of 2.54 cm diameter at a depth of 0.71 m below the water surface. LNG was released over 5.5-min duration, with a flow rate of 0.675 ± 0.223 L/s. The wind speed varied between 2 m/s and 4 m/s during the test. Data were collected as a function of time at a number of locations. These data included LNG flow rate, meteorological conditions, temperatures at a number of locations within the water column, and vapor temperatures and concentrations in air at different downwind locations and heights. Concentration measurements were made with instruments on poles located at 3.05 m, 6.1 m and 9.14 m from the downwind edge of the pit and at heights 0.46 m, 1.22 m, and 2.13 m. The phenomena occurring underwater were recorded with an underwater video camera. Water surface and in-air phenomena including the dispersion of the vapor emanating from the water surface were captured on three land-based video cameras. The lowest temperature recorded for the vapor emanating from the water surface was −1 °C indicating that the vapor emitted into air was buoyant. In general the maximum concentration observed at each instrument pole was progressively at higher and higher elevations as one traveled downwind, indicating that the vapor cloud was rising. These findings from the instrument recorded data were supported by the visual record showing the “white” cloud rising, more or less vertically, in air. No LNG pool was observed on the surface of water. Discussions are provided on the test findings and comparison with predictions from a previously published theoretical model.},

abstract = {Urban physics is the science and engineering of physical processes in urban areas. It basically refers to the transfer of heat and mass in the outdoor and indoor urban environment, and its interaction with humans, fauna, flora and materials. Urban physics is a rapidly increasing focus area as it is key to understanding and addressing the grand societal challenges climate change, energy, health, security, transport and aging. The main assessment tools in urban physics are field measurements, full-scale and reduced-scale laboratory measurements and numerical simulation methods including Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). In the past 50 years, CFD has undergone a successful transition from an emerging field into an increasingly established field in urban physics research, practice and design. This review and position paper consists of two parts. In the first part, the importance of urban physics related to the grand societal challenges is described, after which the spatial and temporal scales in urban physics and the associated model categories are outlined. In the second part, based on a brief theoretical background, some views on CFD are provided. Possibilities and limitations are discussed, and in particular, ten tips and tricks towards accurate and reliable CFD simulations are presented. These tips and tricks are certainly not intended to be complete, rather they are intended to complement existing CFD best practice guidelines on ten particular aspects. Finally, an outlook to the future of CFD for urban physics is given.},

abstract = {Large-Eddy Simulation (LES), Detached-Eddy Simulation (DES) and Scale-Adaptive Simulation (SAS) are increasingly being used as engineering tools to predict the behaviour of complex industrial flows. Often the flows studied have not been examined previously and the required grid resolution is unknown. Industrial users studying these flows tend to be using commercial CFD codes and do not usually have access to high-performance computing facilities. Due to the significant computing times required, it is difficult to undertake systematic grid-dependence studies. There is therefore a risk that LES, DES and SAS will be performed using overly coarse grids which may lead to unreliable predictions. The present work surveys a number of practical techniques that provide a means of assessing the quality of the grid resolution in large-eddy simulations and related approaches. To examine the usefulness of these techniques, a gas release in a ventilated room is examined using DES and SAS. The grid resolution measures indicate that overall the grids used are relatively coarse. Both DES and SAS model predictions are found to be in poor agreement with experimental data compared to steady and unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) results using the SST model. The SAS model also shows the greatest grid sensitivity of the four models tested. The work highlights the need for grid-dependence studies and the potential problems of using coarse grids.},

It may break up into drops of diameters comparable to the jet diameter or into droplets of diameters several orders of magnitude smaller. The sizes of the drops formed from a liquid jet without external control are in general not uniform. The sizes as well as the size distribution depend on the range of flow parameters in which the jet is produced. The jet breakup exhibits different characteristics in different regimes of the relevant flow parameters because of the different physical mechanisms involved. Some recent works based on linear stability theories aimed at the delineation of the different regimes and elucidation of the associated physical mechanisms are reviewed, with the intention of presenting current scientific knowledge on the subject. The unresolved scientific issues are pointed out.},

abstract = {Federal safety regulations require the use of validated consequence models to determine the vapor cloud dispersion exclusion zones for accidental liquefied natural gas (LNG) releases. One tool that is being developed in industry for exclusion zone determination and LNG vapor dispersion modeling is computational fluid dynamics (CFD). This paper uses the ANSYS CFX CFD code to model LNG vapor dispersion in the atmosphere. Discussed are important parameters that are essential inputs to the ANSYS CFX simulations, including the atmospheric conditions, LNG evaporation rate and pool area, turbulence in the source term, ground surface temperature and roughness height, and effects of obstacles. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to illustrate uncertainties in the simulation results arising from the mesh size and source term turbulence intensity. In addition, a set of medium-scale LNG spill tests were performed at the Brayton Fire Training Field to collect data for validating the ANSYS CFX prediction results. A comparison of test data with simulation results demonstrated that CFX was able to describe the dense gas behavior of LNG vapor cloud, and its prediction results of downwind gas concentrations close to ground level were in approximate agreement with the test data.},

The standard does allow the alternative use of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) methods, which serve to compound the concern with these formulae: the predicted volume of the gas cloud from CFD models being several orders of magnitude smaller than that given by the formulae in question. To resolve such major discrepancies, replacement of the current formulae with a scientifically validated approach is proposed. Integral models of dispersion and ventilation have been used routinely for many years in the analysis of major hazards in the chemical industry. This paper presents an adaptation of these models to determine the expected volume of a gas cloud arising from a release of gas from a pressurised source. A very simple integral jet model is presented for outdoor dispersion, extended to the case of indoor dispersion, from which the volume of the gas cloud is derived. The single free parameter, an entrainment coefficient, is fixed by comparison with data on a free jet, and then predictions of the model are compared with CFD calculations (which themselves have been validated against experimental data) for dispersion within an enclosed volume. The results of this simple integral model are seen to agree very well with the CFD predictions. The methodology presented here is therefore proposed as a scientifically validated approach to Hazardous Area Classification.},

abstract = {A simple coupled Volume of Fluid (VOF) with Level Set (LS) method (S-CLSVOF) for improved surface tension implementation is proposed and tested by comparison against a standard VOF solver and experimental observations. A CFD Open source solver library (OpenFOAM{\textregistered}) is used for the VOF method, where the volume fraction is advected algebraically using a compressive scheme. This method has been found not to be suitable for problems with high surface tension effects and it is extended by coupling it with a LS method which is used to calculate the surface tension and the interface curvature. Two test cases; a circular bubble at equilibrium and a free bubble rise, are studied first to examine the accuracy of the S-CLSVOF method. The problem of 3D axi-symmetrical air bubble injection into quiescent water using different volumetric flow rates is then considered to assess the method under challenging capillary dominant conditions. An experimental study has been performed to validate the numerical methods with reference to the geometrical characteristics of the bubble during the full history of formation. The exponential power law controlling the detachment process is investigated. In addition, the influence of the static contact angle imposed at the rigid wall is considered. The results have shown that the coupling code (S-CLSVOF) improves the accuracy of the original VOF method when the surface tension influence is predominant. The two methods provide similar results during the detachment stage of the process due to the large increase of the gas inertia effect. Finally, the static contact angle boundary condition was shown to allow accurate modeling provided that the imposed static contact angle is less than the minimum instantaneous values observed experimentally. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Each and every quantitative risk assessment comprises some basic activities that have to be developed to allow the quantification of the risks involved in the operation of a system or process. Basically, it must be estimated the likelihood of the identified undesired events as well as the magnitude of their consequences. When analyzing the risks in the operation of a ship, the same process has to be followed. For each specific phase of the ship mission, all undesired events must be correctly determined and evaluated. Many different types of undesired events must be investigated, such as: collision, grounding, fire, and explosion. There are many techniques and much work involved in the estimation of the likelihood of the events. The same occurs for the evaluation of their consequences. The purpose of this paper is to study the consequences of a liquefied natural gas (LNG) leakage from the rupture of a pipeline from an LNG vessel during cargo loading at a terminal in the Brazilian coast. Once defined the total leaked quantity, a software will be used to calculate the consequences. The main idea is to identify all possible consequences and verify their magnitudes on the coast. This is not a simple task because it requires the comprehension of the development of the phenomena involved after the leakage. There is also the need of the identification of many variables, including the atmospheric conditions and the ignition sources, in order to verify the extent of possible cascading events. It will be taken special attention to consequences to human beings as a result of exposure to heat radiation effects from possible fires and explosions. As a preliminary study, where the likelihood of the events will not be estimated, the final objective is to use the obtained results to predict preventive and mitigating measures, in order to reduce the consequences to people on the coast.},

abstract = {To be able to perform proper consequence modelling as a part of a risk assessment, it is essential to be able to model the physical processes well. Simplified tools for dispersion and explosion predictions are generally not very useful. CFD tools have the potential to model the relevant physics and predict well, but without proper user guidelines based on extensive validation work, very mixed prediction capability can be expected. In this article, recent dispersion validation effort for the CFD tool FLACS–HYDROGEN is presented. A range of different experiments is simulated, including low-momentum releases in a garage, subsonic jets in a garage with stratification effects and subsequent slow diffusion, low momentum and subsonic horizontal jets influenced by buoyancy, and free jets from high-pressure vessels. LH2 releases are also considered. Some of the simulations are performed as blind predictions.},

Three generations of ``compressible models'' are depicted: a first one based on variable density and compressible adjustments of ``incompressible'' schemes, a second one in which it is presumed that explicit dilatational terms can account for variable density and compressibility effects, and a third one, where such effects are taken implicitly in association with structural changes of the turbulent field. The latter are hardly tractable when using first-order closure schemes, but more reliable than the former in accounting for most observed variable density and compressibility effects in turbulent shear flows.},

abstract = {Consequence analysis of LNG hazards requires modeling of liquid spills on land and water surfaces. The liquid spill duration, release rate, and rate of vaporization are important factors for the estimation of safe separation distances for flammable vapor dispersion and thermal radiation from pool fires. Dispersion distances calculated to ½ LFL are required for the siting of LNG facilities. For an LNG spill, NFPA 59A (2001) requires facilities to have impoundments be sited such that the average concentration of methane in air does not exceed 50{\%} of its lower flammability limit (LFL) beyond the property line1. The federal code of regulations for siting LNG facilities in 49 CFR Part 193 allows the use of both DEGADIS and FEM3A2 for dispersion analysis. DEGADIS is a refined box model while FEM3A is a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. There is no defined model for calculating the source term. LNG dispersion analysis is heavily influenced by the estimation of the source term: (a) the leak rate and duration, and (b) the pool spreading and vaporization. LNG vapors are heavier than air. They usually form low, pancake shaped clouds which spread due to their own density even in the absence of wind. Since the heavy gas dispersion behavior of LNG is different from buoyant clouds, numerous models have been proposed to mathematically represent heavy gas dispersion. The proliferation of dispersion models has resulted in several good dispersion models. DEGADIS and FEM3A are two such heavy gas dispersion computer programs recommended for calculating flammable vapor dispersion distances. The applicability of a mathematical model generally depends on the degree to which important physical phenomenon are represented. In that regards, FEM3A is least limited by various approximations but at the same time needs significantly more computational time. FEM3A is free of surface geometry constraints and can treat obstacles. However, in general, the quality of predictions of dispersion models is very similar, as demonstrated in Table 1 and Table 2. The selection of dispersion models does not appear to significantly affect the quality of results. A sophisticated dispersion model will produce the wrong answer if the source term (vaporization rates and duration) used are in error. We need to establish realistic, accurate, and prudent estimates of the vaporization rates. Fortunately, and despite several factors that are difficult to quantify such as wave action for spills on water, we can use existing methods to establish safe estimates of pool spreading and dynamic vaporization rates. This paper discusses the theoretical basis for SuperChems™' dynamic pool spreading model and details the performance of SuperChems™ against several field data sets for a wide variety of fluids including LNG.},

@article{Lazeroms2013,
abstract = {AbstractThis work describes the derivation of an algebraic model for the Reynolds stresses and turbulent heat flux in stably stratified turbulent flows, which are mutually coupled for this type of flow. For general two-dimensional mean flows, we present a correct way of expressing the Reynolds-stress anisotropy and the (normalized) turbulent heat flux as tensorial combinations of the mean strain rate, the mean rotation rate, the mean temperature gradient and gravity. A system of linear equations is derived for the coefficients in these expansions, which can easily be solved with computer algebra software for a specific choice of the model constants. The general model is simplified in the case of parallel mean shear flows where the temperature gradient is aligned with gravity. For this case, fully explicit and coupled expressions for the Reynolds-stress tensor and heat-flux vector are given. A self-consistent derivation of this model would, however, require finding a root of a polynomial equation of sixth-order, for which no simple analytical expression exists. Therefore, the nonlinear part of the algebraic equations is modelled through an approximation that is close to the consistent formulation. By using the framework of a {\$}K\backslashtext{\{}{\{}\backslashndash{\}}{\}} \backslashomega {\$} model (where {\$}K{\$} is turbulent kinetic energy and {\$}\backslashomega {\$} an inverse time scale) and, where needed, near-wall corrections, the model is applied to homogeneous shear flow and turbulent channel flow, both with stable stratification. For the case of homogeneous shear flow, the model predicts a critical Richardson number of 0.25 above which the turbulent kinetic energy decays to zero. The channel-flow results agree well with DNS data. Furthermore, the model is shown to be robust and approximately self-consistent. It also fulfils the requirements of realizability.},

abstract = {The primary objective of the research discussed here was to compare the commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software, CONVERGE, and a prevalent open-source code, OpenFOAM, with regard to their ability to predict spray and combustion characteristics. The high-fidelity data were obtained from the Engine Combustion Network (ECN) at Sandia National Laboratory in a constant-volume combustion vessel under well-defined, controlled conditions. The experiments and simulations were performed by using two diesel surrogate fuels (i.e., n-heptane and n-dodecane) under both non-reacting and reacting conditions. Specifically, ECN data on spray penetration, liquid length, vapor penetration, mixture fraction, ignition delay, and flame lift-off length (LOL) were used to validate both codes. Results indicate that both codes can predict the above experimental characteristics very well. The simulations incorporated similar approaches for spray and combustion modeling, with some differences in the choice of sub-models and their associated constants. For example, for both codes, the smallest preferred grid size chosen was 0.25 mm and adaptive mesh resolution was used to capture regions characterized by high densities, temperatures, species gradients. In addition, the chemical-kinetic models for n-heptane oxidation were also the same for both the codes. After extensive validation of the modeling tools, parametric studies were performed to characterize the effect of the grid size, time-step size, and turbulence models on the above-mentioned parameters. For the minimum grid sizes chosen, both codes were grid dependent. CONVERGE was time-step independent, but it was more dependent than OpenFOAM was on mesh size for vapor penetration if the larger grid was used. The turbulence model had a greater impact on vapor penetration than on liquid penetration. Under reacting conditions, some differences in ignition characteristics, flame LOL, equivalence ratio, temperature, and OH mass fraction distributions were observed between the codes. In general, there was good agreement between predictions by both CONVERGE and OpenFOAM against experimental data, although flame LOL was better predicted by CONVERGE. Finally, throughout this study the two approaches used different definitions for several terms (liquid and vapor penetration, ignition delay, lift-off), which provides a strong motivation for standardizing the parameters further by enveloping the experimental definitions for spray and combustion parameters.},

The theoretical results are applicable also to hot-fire plumes spreading under a cold ceiling. They have been verified by comparison with existing experiments in channels, i.e. a heavy-gas (cryogenic) ground release as well as a hot-fire plume under the ceiling. A simple analytic solution is also given, which shows explicitly the role of various (dimensionless) parameters. This simplified solution shows good agreement with both the exact numerical solution and the experiments and it requires only algebraic evaluation.},

abstract = {Accurate Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations of atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) flow are essential for a wide variety of atmospheric studies including pollutant dispersion and deposition. The accuracy of such simulations can be seriously compromised when wall-function roughness modifications based on experimental data for sand-grain roughened pipes and channels are applied at the bottom of the computational domain. This type of roughness modification is currently present in many CFD codes including Fluent 6.2 and Ansys CFX 10.0, previously called CFX-5. The problems typically manifest themselves as unintended streamwise gradients in the vertical mean wind speed and turbulence profiles as they travel through the computational domain. These gradients can be held responsible—at least partly—for the discrepancies that are sometimes found between seemingly identical CFD simulations performed with different CFD codes and between CFD simulations and measurements. This paper discusses the problem by focusing on the simulation of a neutrally stratified, fully developed, horizontally homogeneous ABL over uniformly rough, flat terrain. The problem and its negative consequences are discussed and suggestions to improve the CFD simulations are made.},

abstract = {The main focus in the analysis of pool or flow boiling in saturated or subcooled conditions is the basic understanding of the phase change process through the heat transfer and wall heat flux partitioning at the heated wall and the two-phase bubble behaviours in the bulk liquid as they migrate away from the heated wall. This paper reviews the work in this rapid developing area with special reference to modelling nucleate boiling of cryogenic liquids in the context of computational fluid dynamics and associated theoretical developments. The partitioning of the wall heat flux at the heated wall into three components ? single-phase convection, transient conduction and evaporation ? remains the most popular mechanistic approach in predicting the heat transfer process during boiling. Nevertheless, the respective wall heat flux components generally require the determination of the active nucleation site density, bubble departure diameter and nucleation frequency, which are crucial to the proper prediction of the heat transfer process. Numerous empirical correlations presented in this paper have been developed to ascertain these three important parameters with some degree of success. Albeit the simplicity of empirical correlations, they remain applicable to only a narrow range of flow conditions. In order to extend the wall heat flux partitioning approach to a wider range of flow conditions, the fractal model proposed for the active nucleation site density, force balance model for bubble departing from the cavity and bubble lifting off from the heated wall and evaluation of nucleation frequency based on fundamental theory depict the many enhancements that can improve the mechanistic model predictions. The macroscopic consideration of the two-phase boiling in the bulk liquid via the two-fluid model represents the most effective continuum approach in predicting the volume fraction and velocity distributions of each phase. Nevertheless, the interfacial mass, momentum and energy exchange terms that appear in the transport equations generally require the determination of the Sauter mean diameter or interfacial area concentration, which strongly governs the fluid flow and heat transfer in the bulk liquid. In order to accommodate the dynamically changing bubble sizes that are prevalent in the bulk liquid, the mechanistic approach based on the population balance model allows the appropriate prediction of local distributions of Sauter mean diameter or interfacial area concentration, which in turn can improve the predictions of the interfacial mass, momentum and energy exchanges that occur across the interface between the phases. Need for further developments are discussed.},

In order to also predict the gas build-up, very, the functionality very soon was extended to include dispersion. During three decades extensive validation against experiments has been given high priority in the FLACS development. FLACS is now considered to be a leading CFD-tool for gas explosion modeling, the modeling of hydrogen dispersion and explosion, dust explosion modeling and for dispersion modeling in offshore and onshore congested process areas. With support from Norsk Hydro, Total, Statoil and Petroleum Safety Authority Norway (PSA), and in cooperation with DNV, a LNG-development and validation project for FLACS has been carried out recently. The first phase of the project was a validation activity in which 8 tests from Burro and 3 tests from Coyote experiments performed at China Lake (USA), and 4 tests from Maplin Sands (UK) have been simulated. Predicted downwind maximum gas concentrations at various distances have been compared to experiments showing good correlation. This validation activity will be presented in the current paper. Models have been further developed to extend the pool simulation capabilities to allow the formation and spread of a pool with local evaporation rates based on heat from ground, wind speed, local vapor pressure. These models will be described, and simulation examples will be shown. The combination of a good description of physical models and the ability to take into account buildings, terrain or process plants is essential for a proper consequence modeling of LNG-releases.},

abstract = {When an azo dye is converted from the trans to the cis form, there occur two kinds of changes: (1) a change in geometry, with accompanying absorption spectral changes (photochromism), and (2) a change in intermolecular interactions and crystal packing in which the molecule can engage. For example, cis azoben-zene derivatives frequently melt at a considerably different temperature from that of the corresponding trans isomers.' If such chromophores were parts of polymers, or bound to them, it seemed possible that light energy might be made to influence the conformation of the polymers. This seems reasonable from a thermodynamic standpoint. Non-cross-linked polyelectrolytes, for example, if capable of undergoing enthalpy-dominated con-formation changes, usually do so upon acquiring 10-100 kcal of electrostatic energy per mole for an ordinary sized (mol wt 104 to 106) macromolecule.2 Near-ultraviolet and visible light possess 40-90 kcal of energy per einstein. Upon absorption of it, a considerable fraction may be used in activation processes, but in the case of azobenzene itself, there is a residue of potential energy difference stored in the isomers which amounts to 9.9 kcal3 (the trans form being the most stable). Since the quantum yields of the azo dye trans -0 cis conversions used in this study are of the order of 0.2, it would seem that for a light-sensitive macro-molecule utilizing only one chromophore and one einstein, the probability of ener-gizing a conformation change is of the order of 0.1. It is easy, however, to syn-thesize various systems with many chromophores per macromolecule, and with a reasonable supply of light (of the order of 1015 quanta/cm2/sec), it seemed possible to inject enough light energy to force a macromolecular conformation change, assuming no severe kinetic limitations. Various kinds of systems might be used to convert light energy isothermally to potential energy, stored in a macromolecule in such a way as to change its confor-mation. The method used to observe conformation changes in this study was measurement of the relative specific viscosity. If a macromolecule in solution is forced by light into a changed conformation, it might be expected to engage in changed interaction with some of the species present in solution with which it was previously in equilibrium. If this causes a change in},

abstract = {In the United States, liquefied natural gas (LNG) has the unique distinction of being the only flammable or hazardous material whose storage terminal (siting), handling and terminal operations are regulated by the federal government. Regulations are promulgated by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Administration (PHMSA) of the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT). Storage and handling of all other flammable and hazardous materials are regulated by state laws. Current DOT regulations on LNG (49 CFR, part 193) are based on NFPA 59A, “Standard for the Production, Storage, and Handling of Liquefied Natural Gas,” 2001 edition. These regulations are very prescriptive and inflexible in that they do not allow alternative safety mitigation considerations for LNG facility siting without applying for a special permit. The types and sizes of accidental releases to be evaluated are prescribed and no deviation is allowed. Without considering a spectrum of events, their likelihood of occurrence and the resultant consequences it is impossible to design proper mitigation actions or emergency response procedures. The benefit of knowing and preparing for a properly evaluated “most likely event” scenario is the resultant correct application of economics, and personnel resources of emergency responders. The 2009 edition of NFPA 59A includes, in a mandatory annex, an alternative, risk-based requirements to evaluate the safety of land-based LNG facilities. DOT, in its regulations on the transportation of natural gas in interstate pipelines, requires the conduct of a “Pipeline Integrity Management” procedure to ensure public safety from accidental gas releases from interstate pipelines. The regulations refer to this procedure as “risk-based” even though frequencies of accidents or equipment failures are not considered. The National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC) and the National Association of States Fire Marshals (NASFM) have recently passed resolutions calling on DOT (PHMSA) to initiate steps towards the development of risk-based LNG facility siting regulations. This paper discusses the risk evaluation approach incorporated into a mandatory annex in the 2009 edition of NFPA 59A and possible other methods of performing a LNG facility risk assessment. Also discussed are the parameters that society has to agree to establish an ‘acceptable' level of risk. The paper indicates the risk process used in other countries, particularly in Europe. The results from the application of a risk analysis procedure to a specific case are presented. A comparison of the risk-based results with those obtained from the application of the current prescriptive requirements in NFPA 59A (or 49 CFR, part 193) is indicated. Recommendations are provided for future actions.},

Furthermore a prediction of the consequences of the spill of a tanker truck load for different cryogens is given.

abstract = {Abstract The behaviour of spectra and cospectra of turbulence in the surface layer is described within the framework of similarity theory using wind and temperature fluctuation data obtained in the 1968 AFCRL Kansas experiments. With appropriate normalization, the spectra and cospectra are each reduced to a family of curves which spread out according to z/L at low frequencies but converge to a single universal curve in the inertial subrange. The paper compares these results with data obtained by other investigators over both land and water. Spectral constants for velocity and temperature are determined and the variability in the recent estimates of the constants is discussed. The high-frequency behaviour is consistent with local isotropy. In the inertial subrange, where the spectra fall as n?5/3, the cospectra fall faster: u? and ?? as n?7/3, and u?, on the average, as n?5/2. The 4/3 ratio between the transverse and longitudinal spectral levels is observed at wavelengths of the order of the height above ground under unstable conditions and at wavelengths of the order of L/10 under stable conditions. This lower isotropic limit is shown to be governed by the combined effects of shear and buoyancy on small-scale eddies.},

abstract = {Fifteen hazardous gas models were evaluated using data from eight field experiments. The models include seven publicly available models (AFTOX, DEGADIS, HEGADAS, HGSYSTEM, INPUFF, OB/DG and SLAB), six proprietary models (AIRTOX, CHARM, FOCUS, GASTAR, PHAST and TRACE), and two “benchmark” analytical models (the Gaussian Plume Model and the analytical approximations to the Britter and McQuaid Workbook nomograms). The field data were divided into three groups—continuous dense gas releases (Burro LNG, Coyote LNG, Desert Tortoise NH3-gas and aerosols, Goldfish HF-gas and aerosols, and Maplin Sands LNG), continuous passive gas releases (Prairie Grass and Hanford), and instantaneous dense gas releases (Thorney Island freon). The dense gas models that produced the most consistent predictions of plume centerline concentrations across the dense gas data sets are the Britter and McQuaid, CHARM, GASTAR, HEGADAS, HGSYSTEM, PHAST, SLAB and TRACE models, with relative mean biases of about ±30{\%} or less and magnitudes of relative scatter that are about equal to the mean. The dense gas models tended to overpredict the plume widths and underpredict the plume depths by about a factor of two. All models except GASTAR, TRACE, and the area source version of DEGADIS perform fairly well with the continuous passive gas data sets. Some sensitivity studies were also carried out. It was found that three of the more widely used publicly-available dense gas models (DEGADIS, HGSYSTEM and SLAB) predicted increases in concentration of about 70{\%} as roughness length decreased by an order of magnitude for the Desert Tortoise and Goldfish field studies. It was also found that none of the dense gas models that were considered came close to simulating the observed factor of two increase in peak concentrations as averaging time decreased from several minutes to 1 s. Because of their assumption that a concentrated dense gas core existed that was unaffected by variations in averaging time, the dense gas models predicted, at most, a 20{\%} increase in concentrations for this variation in averaging time.},

abstract = {Integral models for heavy gas dispersion approximate a dispersing cloud in terms of a small number of variables; each of these is ultimately a function of an independent variable which is usually time (instantaneous releases) or downwind distance (continuous releases). This type of model is used almost exclusively in risk assessment [HSE's risk assessment tool, RISKAT, in: Major Hazards: Onshore and Offshore, October 1992, pp. 607–638; Ann. Rev. Fluid Mech. 21 (1989) 317], but many distinct integral models exist. The code comparison exercise of Mercer et al. [CEA/AEA exchange agreement on external event. Comparison of heavy gas dispersion models for instantaneous releases: final report, Technical Report IR/L/HA/91/6, Health and Safety Laboratory, Sheffield, June 1991; J. Hazard. Mater. 36 (1994) 193] presented the results from a number of integral models in a common format; Mercer found that the range of predictions for some scenarios exceeded three orders of magnitude. Here, the TWODEE shallow layer model [J. Hazard. Mater. 66 (3) (1999) 211; J. Hazard. Mater. 66 (3) (1999) 227; J. Hazard. Mater. 66 (3) (1999) 239] is added to Mercer's code comparison exercise. The physical assumptions used in shallow layer models differ profoundly from those used in integral models and the implications of these differences for risk assessment are discussed. TWODEE was used to simulate four representative cases considered by Mercer. In terms of cloud averaged concentration (CAC) vs. centroid position, the present model gave predictions that were consistent with the integral models used by Mercer. As the model neglects horizontal diffusion for passive clouds, overprediction at large downwind distances was expected, but not generally observed.},

abstract = {In this paper, a computational approach to the atmospheric dispersion that is associated with cryogenic releases of the gaseous fuels hydrogen and natural gas was attempted. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method was followed, using the code CFX 5.7 for the simulation of large-scale liquefied hydrogen and liquefied natural gas spill trials, which provided successful prediction of the concentration histories, against experimental records. The main outcome that was determined through the results was that fuel gases, such as natural gas and hydrogen, disperse as heavy gases rather than light gases during a cryogenic release, despite their positive buoyancy under normal conditions. This conclusion is of major importance from the standpoint of safety, in regard to chemical installations that handle liquefied gases, given that the gravity-driven dispersion of flammable gases increases the risk of ignition and, hence, accidental fire or explosion. Thus, the behavior of the released gas should be known when ...},

@article{Spaulding2007,
abstract = {LNGMAP, a fully integrated, geographic information based modular system, has been developed to predict the fate and transport of marine spills of LNG. The model is organized as a discrete set of linked algorithms that represent the processes (time dependent release rate, spreading, transport on the water surface, evaporation from the water surface, transport and dispersion in the atmosphere, and, if ignited, burning and associated radiated heat fields) affecting LNG once it is released into the environment. A particle-based approach is employed in which discrete masses of LNG released from the source are modeled as individual masses of LNG or spillets. The model is designed to predict the gas mass balance as a function of time and to display the spatial and temporal evolution of the gas (and radiated energy field). LNGMAP has been validated by comparisons to predictions of models developed by ABS Consulting and Sandia for time dependent point releases from a draining tank, with and without burning. Simulations were in excellent agreement with those performed by ABS Consulting and consistent with Sandia's steady state results. To illustrate the model predictive capability for realistic emergency scenarios, simulations were performed for a tanker entering Block Island Sound. Three hypothetical cases were studied: the first assumes the vessel continues on course after the spill starts, the second that the vessel stops as soon as practical after the release begins (3 min), and the third that the vessel grounds at the closest site practical. The model shows that the areas of the surface pool and the incident thermal radiation field (with burning) are minimized and dispersed vapor cloud area (without burning) maximized if the vessel continues on course. For this case the surface pool area, with burning, is substantially smaller than for the without burning case because of the higher mass loss rate from the surface pool due to burning. Since the vessel speed substantially exceeds the spill spreading rate, both the thermal radiation fields and surface pool trail the vessel. The relative directions and speeds of the wind and vessel movement govern the orientation of the dispersed plume. If the vessel stops, the areas of the surface pool and incident radiation field (with burning) are maximized and the dispersed cloud area (without burning) minimized. The longer the delay in stopping the vessel, the smaller the peak values are for the pool area and the size of the thermal radiation field. Once the vessel stops, the spill pool is adjacent to the vessel and moving down current. The thermal radiation field is oriented similarly. These results may be particularly useful in contingency planning for underway vessels.},

abstract = {When modelling the turbulent dispersion of a passive tracer using Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) simulations, two different approaches can be used. The first consists of solving a transport equation for a scalar, where the governing parameters are the mean velocity field and the turbulent diffusion coefficient, given by the ratio of the turbulent viscosity and the turbulent Schmidt number Sc t . The second approach uses a Lagrangian particle tracking algorithm, where the governing parameters are the mean velocity and the fluctuating velocity field, which is determined from the turbulence kinetic energy and the Lagrangian time T L . A comparison between the two approaches and wind-tunnel data for the dispersion in the wake of a rectangular building immersed in a neutral atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) is presented. Particular attention was paid to the influence of turbulence model parameters on the flow and concentration field. In addition, an approach to estimate Sc t and T L based on the calculated flow field is proposed. The results show that applying modified turbulence model constants to enable correct modelling of the ABL improves the prediction for the velocity and concentration fields when the modification is restricted to the region for which it was derived. The difference between simulated and measured concentrations is smaller than 25{\%} or the uncertainty of the data on 76{\%} of the points when solving the transport equation for a scalar with the proposed formulation for Sc t , and on 69{\%} of the points when using the Lagrangian particle tracking with the proposed formulation for T L .},

abstract = {The use of LNG (liquefied natural gas) as fuel brings up issues regarding safety and acceptable risk. The potential hazards associated with an accidental LNG spill should be evaluated, and a useful tool in LNG safety assessment is computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation. In this paper, the ADREA-HF code has been applied to simulate LNG dispersion in open-obstructed environment based on Falcon Series Experiments. During these experiments LNG was released and dispersed over water surface. The spill area is confined with a billboard upwind of the water pond. FA1 trial was chosen to be simulated, because its release and weather conditions (high total spill volume and release rate, low wind speed) allow the gravitational force to influence the cold, dense vapor cloud and can be considered as a benchmark for LNG dispersion in fenced area. The source was modeled with two different approaches: as vapor pool and as two phase jet and the predicted methane concentration at sensors' location was compared with the experimental one. It is verified that the source model affect to a great extent the LNG dispersion and the best case was the one modeling the source as two phase jet. However, the numerical results in the case of two phase jet source underestimate the methane concentration for most of the sensors. Finally, the paper discusses the effect of neglecting the −9.3° experimental wind direction, which leads to the symmetry assumption with respect to wind and therefore less computational costs. It was found that this effect is small in case of a jet source but large in the case of a pool source.},

A recently proposed closure for the Scalar Dissipation Rate (SDR) is used for the modelling of the filtered reaction rate of reaction progress variable, whereas the Favre filtered mixture fraction is used to account for mixture stratification due to entrainment. The computational results are utilised to analyse the nature of stratification at representative locations in the swirl flame to gain physical insight into the flame structure. Additionally, two algebraic Flame Surface Density (FSD) closures, which were found to perform well in a previous analysis (Ma et al., 2013), are used for the modelling of the filtered reaction rate of reaction progress variable. The predictions of SDR closure are compared to the corresponding results obtained from algebraic FSD closures. The predictions of SDR based simulations show reasonably good agreement with experimental findings; the level of accuracy is at least comparable to that achieved with algebraic FSD models and to the results reported in the literature.},

@article{Cavar2016,
abstract = {The flow solvers OpenFOAM and EllipSys3D are compared in the case of neutral atmospheric flow over terrain using the test cases of Askervein and Bolund hills. Both solvers are run using the steady-state Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes k– turbulence model. One of the main modeling differences between the two solvers is the wall-function approach. The Open-FOAM v.1.7.1 uses a Nikuradse's sand roughness model, while EllipSys3D uses a model based on the atmospheric roughness length. It is found that Nikuradse's model introduces an error dependent on the near-wall cell height. To mitigate this error the near-wall cells should be at least 10 times larger than the surface roughness. It is nonetheless possible to obtain very similar results between EllipSys3D and OpenFOAM v.1.7.1. The more recent OpenFOAM v.2.2.1, which includes the atmospheric roughness length wall-function approach, has also been tested and compared to the results of OpenFOAM v.1.7.1 and EllipSys3D. The numerical results obtained using the same wall-modeling approach in both EllipSys3D and Open-FOAM v.2.1.1 proved to be almost identical. Two meshing strategies are investigated using HypGrid and SnappyHexMesh. The performance of Open-FOAM on SnappyHexMesh-based low-aspect-ratio unstructured meshes is found to be almost an order of magnitude faster than on HypGrid-based structured and high-aspect-ratio meshes. However, proper control of boundary layer resolution is found to be very difficult when the SnappyHexMesh tool is utilized for grid generation purposes. The OpenFOAM is generally found to be 2–6 times slower than EllipSys3D in achieving numerical results of the same order of accuracy on similar or identical computational meshes, when utilization of EllipSys3D default grid sequencing procedures is included.},

Among the different types of unstable responses, buckling is a phenomenon that has been known for centuries, and yet it is generally avoided through special design modifications. Increasing interest in the design of smart devices and mechanical systems has identified buckling and postbuckling response as a favorable behavior. The objective of this topical review is to showcase the recent advances in buckling-induced smart applications and to explain why buckling responses have certain advantages and are especially suitable for these particular applications. Interesting prototypes in terms of structural forms and material uses associated with these applications are summarized. Finally, this review identifies potential research avenues and emerging trends for using buckling and other elastic instabilities for future innovations.},

The results are then applied to solving an inverse problem in which emission source rates are determined from a given set of ground-level contaminant measurements. This source identification problem can be formulated as an overdetermined linear system of equations that is most easily solved using the method of least squares. Various generalizations of this problem are discussed, and we illustrate our results with an application to the study of zinc emissions from a smelting operation.},

@article{Riddle2004a,
abstract = {The dispersion of gases in complex situations such as the case of buildings in close proximity is a difficult problem, but important for the safety of people living and working in such areas. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) provides a method to build and run models that can simulate gas dispersion in such geometrically complex situations; however, the accuracy of the results needs to be assessed. As a first step in such an assessment, this study considers the simulation of the dynamics of the basic atmospheric boundary layer using the FLUENT CFD code and the prediction of gas dispersion from a single stack. The CFD results are compared with the predictions from the Atmospheric Dispersion Modelling System (ADMS), a well tested and validated quasi-Gaussian model. When FLUENT was set up to simulate the neutrally stable atmospheric boundary layer, the mean velocity profiles were well predicted and were maintained with downwind distance. The algebraic Reynolds stress turbulence model provided the best predictions for the turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) and dissipation. The dissipation rate was maintained throughout the length of the model domain and, on average, the TKE levels were within 80{\%} of the expected values up to a height of 100m, but at the ground reduced to 50{\%} of the inlet values. Predictions of TKE using the simpler k–$\epsilon$ model turbulence was much poorer. Spread of the gas plume were predicted using an advection-diffusion (AD) method, a Lagrangian particle tracking (LP) method and a large eddy simulation (LES) method. The LP method gave the best results; the horizontal and vertical plume spreads were similar to those predicted by ADMS and ground level and plume centre line concentrations were close to ADMS values. However, some differences were observed with the ground level concentrations rising more rapidly with distance than for ADMS, but reaching similar peak values while the plume centreline concentrations dropped more rapidly than in ADMS. For the AD method the horizontal cross-wind plume spread was significantly lower than expected resulting in higher ground level concentrations than predicted by ADMS, an effect that was attributed to the isotropic formulation of the AD equation in FLUENT. The LES results were intermediate between the AD and LP predictions. Overall, the CFD simulations with the LP method were satisfactory; however, they could not be considered as an appropriate alternative to a model such as ADMS for normal atmospheric dispersion studies because of the much larger run times and the greater complexity of setting up model runs. CFD is more appropriate for applications that involve complex geometry that could not be simulated using ADMS; however, further studies are required to assess the ability of CFD to calculate dispersion in such situations, for instance, around groups of buildings and under a range of atmospheric stability conditions, rather than just the neutral stability considered in this paper.},

abstract = {The open source flow solver OpenFOAM 1.6.x is validated for the computation of the statistically steady turbulent flow around single and multiple obstacles. To that end the Reynolds Averaged Navier–Stokes equations are solved together with the standard k–$\epsilon$ turbulence model. Five cases are computed comprising a 2D beam, a wall mounted cube, a wall mounted cube rotated by 45° against the approach flow, a cuboid and an array of 21 cuboids. A block structured hexahedral, an unstructured tetrahedral and an unstructured hybrid mesh of tetrahedra and prisms are used for each case. The computed mean velocity components are compared with corresponding experimental results. From the relative or absolute difference of the results a hit rate is computed. For all cases and meshes the computed hit rate is larger than the hit rate required for successful validation if all available measurement positions are taken into account. When only positions in the near field are used for the hit rate, at least for one case and velocity component the successful validation criterion is not met, independent of the mesh. Thus only partial validation is achieved, which is consistent with published results obtained with other flow solvers. Furthermore it is shown that the metrics are not very sensitive to the choice of numerical and physical parameters, which raises the question whether the pass or fail criterion adopted by the guideline is too weak.},

The large eddies in the atmospheric boundary layer are believed to be much more important and more flow-dependent than the small eddies. The LES model results are therefore believed to be relatively insensitive to the parameterization scheme for the small eddies. Deardorff first applied this type of numerical model to boundary-layer turbulence. In order to continue his important work, and to take advantage of the fast Fourier transformation algorithm, a new LES model code which uses a mixed pseudospectral finite-difference method was developed. This LES model is described here and tested with a simple vortex flow and with the Wangara day-33 data. This model will be used to systematically investigate fundamental problems in the area of boundary-layer turbulence.

abstract = {A new method for the analysis of LNG spills into trenches has been developed to quantify vapor dispersion hazard distances. The model uses three steps to capture the behavior of an LNG spill into a trench. The first is to analytically calculate the evolving LNG flow, the second to calculate the vaporization rate along the trench, and the third is to calculate the dispersion of the vapors using a CFD model that has been validated for this application in the presence of complex geometries. This paper presents case studies that show the effect of wind perpendicular and parallel to the large aspect ratio trenches on vapor dispersion. The case studies also demonstrate the effect of complex terrain and obstacles such as vapor fences on vapor dispersion. The simulations show that wind direction relative to the trench has a significant effect on cloud shape, height, and maximum downwind distance. The addition of vapor fences to mitigate vapor dispersion hazards from an LNG spill into the LNG containment trench is shown to be effective.},

This new method is a direct simulation of liquid-vapor phase change heat transfer which is determined by the thermodynamic relation given by the equation of state. Two-dimensional numerical simulations based on this new phase-change LBM are carried out for nucleation of water on a microheater under constant wall temperature and constant heat flux conditions, respectively. Effects of gravity, contact angle and superheat on bubble departure diameter and release period under constant wall temperature conditions are illustrated. The three-phase contact line movement of the vapor bubble, as well as temperature profiles and flow fields inside and outside of the vapor bubble during boiling process are analyzed. Other important information, such as nucleation waiting time and nucleation temperature under constant heat flux conditions, which was unable to obtain by other numerical simulation methods, is obtained and analyzed in this paper for the first time. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

A specific Guideline ("Blue Book") was issued in order to summarize new developments and available data, methods and techniques for the assessment of LNG safety. The present paper will focus on the specific contribution provided by Italian partners of the project to the "Blue Book". In particular, the work carried out on the assessment of specific scenarios related to LNG terminals and on consequence assessment models will be presented. A relevant effort was dedicated to the systematic exploration of credible accident scenarios that may follow external events involving LNG terminals. The results were used to consider the application of improved consequence assessment models both for the prediction of NG dispersion following release and for the Rapid Phase Transition that may be caused by massive LNG releases over water. {\textcopyright} 2011, AIDIC Servizi S.r.L.},

A validated Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model is proposed for natural gas dispersion analysis in an engine room space under multi-factor coupling. Results demonstrate that gas dispersion depends on leakage rate, position and direction of release, temperature gradient, ventilation and the machinery equipment located in the engine room. Under the impact of air flow, temperature gradient and gas-buoyancy, natural gas tends to accumulate on the top of the engine room space, which can be pumped out through air-outlets. Natural gas is likely to concentrate at areas where vortex flows generate. Effective arrangement and locations of gas detectors are discussed considering the variation of gas concentration at several selected point within the engine room space.},

@article{Raman2005,
abstract = {There have been significant advances in consequence modelling of releases of hazardous materials in the last decade, but the use of simple models for predicting overpressures from vapour cloud explosions (VCEs) continues to elude safety practitioners. The TNO multi-energy model has generally been regarded as the best model available to date, for a rapid assessment of explosion overpressures and positive phase durations. This model requires two major assumptions to be made—the level of congestion in the plant that provides obstacles for flame front acceleration, and the explosion efficiency. The former enables the selection of an appropriate charge strength from the family of parametric curves in the model. While there has been some guidance available for making relevant assumptions, there is still a high level of uncertainty in the model results, and the drag load obtained cannot be confidently applied as the basis for structural design. Flame acceleration models based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) have been developed for gas explosion modelling in offshore oil and gas facilities. Sensitivity analysis is conducted on these models, using various cloud sizes and ignition point locations, and the results are processed into an exceedence curve based on event frequencies, in order to obtain the best estimate of peak overpressures and drag loads for design purposes. In this paper, the TNO multi-energy model has been applied to two different configurations of topsides of offshore installations. In these applications the assumptions regarding explosion efficiency and charge strength selections have been calibrated against the results obtained through the CFD modelling, by obtaining a match of the explosion over-pressures. The paper comments on the findings from this exercise in order to give guidance on the application of the TNO multi-energy method and on the selection of model parameters with relation to the equipment lay-out and level of equipment congestion.},

Stratification of the tracer gas was detected in all the configurations studied, even at low concentrations.

abstract = {Predictions of scalar mixing and the scalar dissipation rate from large-eddy simulations of a piloted nonpremixed methane/air diffusion flame (Sandia flame D) using the Lagrangian-type flamelet model are presented. The results obtained for the unconditionally filtered scalar dissipation rate are qualitatively compared with general observations of scalar mixing from experiments in non-reactive and reactive jets. In agreement with experimental data, provided the reaction zone has an inward direction, regions of high scalar dissipation rate are organized in layerlike structures, inwardly inclined to the mean flow and aligned with the instantaneous reaction zone. The analysis of single-point time records of the mixture fraction reveals ramplike structures, which have also been observed experimentally and are believed to indicate large-scale turbulent structures. The probability density function (pdf) of the instantaneous resolved scalar dissipation rate at stoichiometric mixture evaluated at cross sections normal to the the nozzle axis is shown to be described accurately by a lognormal pdf with $\sigma$ = 1. A new model for the conditionally averaged scalar dissipation rate has been proposed and is shown to account for local deviations from the simple mixing layer structure. The stabilizing effect of the pilot flame in the present configuration is also discussed. Finally, the influence of the resolved fluctuations of the scalar dissipation rate on the flame structure is investigated, revealing only a weak influence on temperature and nitric oxide predictions. However, the model requires further refinement for situations in which local extinction events become important.},

abstract = {A hybrid thermal lattice Boltzmann (LB) model is presented to simulate thermal multiphase flows with phase change based on an improved pseudopotential LB approach (Li et al., 2013). The present model does not suffer from the spurious term caused by the forcing-term effect, which was encountered in some previous thermal LB models for liquid-vapor phase change. Using the model, the liquid-vapor boiling process is simulated. The boiling curve together with the three boiling stages (nucleate boiling, transition boiling, and film boiling) is numerically reproduced in the LB community for the first time. The numerical results show that the basic features and the fundamental characteristics of boiling heat transfer are well captured, such as the severe fluctuation of transient heat flux in the transition boiling and the feature that the maximum heat transfer coefficient lies at a lower wall superheat than that of the maximum heat flux. Furthermore, the effects of the heating surface wettability on boiling heat transfer are investigated. It is found that an increase in contact angle promotes the onset of boiling but reduces the critical heat flux, and makes the boiling process enter into the film boiling regime at a lower wall superheat, which is consistent with the findings from experimental studies.},

abstract = {For wind resource assessment, the wind industry is increasingly relying on Computational Fluid Dynamics models that focus on modeling the airflow in a neutrally stratified surface layer. So far, physical processes that are specific to the atmospheric boundary layer, for example the Coriolis force, buoyancy forces and heat transport, are mostly ignored in state-of-the-art flow solvers. In order to decrease the uncertainty of wind resource assessment, the effect of thermal stratification on the atmospheric boundary layer should be included in such models. The present work focuses on non-neutral atmospheric flow over complex terrain including physical processes like stability and Coriolis force. We examine the influence of these effects on the whole atmospheric boundary layer using the DTU Wind Energy flow solver EllipSys3D. To validate the flow solver, measurements from Benakanahalli hill, a field experiment that took place in India in early 2010, are used. The experiment was specifically designed to address the combined effects of stability and Coriolis force over complex terrain, and provides a dataset to validate flow solvers. Including those effects into EllipSys3D significantly improves the predicted flow field when compared against the measurements.},

@article{Cheng2015,
abstract = {Large-eddy simulations (LES) are performed to simulate the atmospheric boundary-layer (ABL) flow through idealized urban canopies represented by uniform arrays of cubes in order to better understand atmospheric flow over rural-to-urban surface transitions. The LES framework is first validated with wind-tunnel experimental data. Good agreement between the simulation results and the experimental data are found for the vertical and spanwise profiles of the mean velocities and velocity standard deviations at different streamwise locations. Next, the model is used to simulate ABL flows over surface transitions from a flat homogeneous terrain to aligned and staggered arrays of cubes with height h. For both configurations, five different frontal area densities (?f), equal to 0.028, 0.063, 0.111, 0.174 and 0.250, are considered. Within the arrays, the flow is found to adjust quickly and shows similar structure to the wake of the cubes after the second row of cubes. An internal boundary layer is identified above the cube arrays and found to have a similar depth in all different cases. At a downstream location where the flow immediately above the cube array is already adjusted to the surface, the spatially-averaged velocity is found to have a logarithmic profile in the vertical. The values of the displacement height are found to be quite insensitive to the canopy layout (aligned vs. staggered) and increase roughly from 0.65h to 0.9h as ?f increases from 0.028 to 0.25. Relatively larger values of the aerodynamic roughness length (z0) are obtained for the staggered arrays, compared with the aligned cases, and a maximum value of z0 is found at ?f=0.111 for both configurations. By explicitly calculating the drag exerted by the cubes on the flow and the drag coefficients of the cubes using our LES results, and comparing the results with existing theoretical expressions, we show that the larger values of z0 for the staggered arrays are related to the relatively larger drag coefficients of the cubes for that configuration compared with the aligned one. The effective mixing length (lm) within and above different cube arrays is also calculated and a local maximum of lm within the canopy is found in all the cases, with values ranging from 0.2h to 0.4h. These patterns of lm are different from those used in existing urban canopy models.},

abstract = {Dynamic control of shape can bring multifunctionality to devices. Soft materials capable of programmable shape change require localized control of the magnitude and directionality of a mechanical response. We report the preparation of soft, ordered materials referred to as liquid crystal elastomers. The direction of molecular order, known as the director, is written within local volume elements (voxels) as small as 0.0005 cubic millimeters. Locally, the director controls the inherent mechanical response (55{\%} strain) within the material. In monoliths with spatially patterned director, thermal or chemical stimuli transform flat sheets into three-dimensional objects through controlled bending and stretching. The programmable mechanical response of these materials could yield monolithic multifunctional devices or serve as reconfigurable substrates for flexible devices in aerospace, medicine, or consumer goods.},

abstract = {Quantifying the size of flammable vapor cloud hazards associated with an accidental release of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) into a spill containment system supported by narrow drainage trenches has posed a modeling challenge since the inception of the LNG industry. Early attempts to treat the vapors evolving from the trenches included using line-source Gaussian models, and the use of the DEGADIS model by modeling "segmented" trench elements and adding the contributions from each trench segment at a specified downwind distance. These approaches often are only reasonable for a select set of conditions (e.g., winds perpendicular to the trench) and have no ability to simulate many of the conditions that might result in a larger potential impact (e.g., winds blowing parallel to the trench). ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Vechot2013,
abstract = {The prediction of the potential hazards associated to accidental liquefied natural gas (LNG) spills has motivated a number of different studies including experimental and numerical approaches. Most of these studies focus on dispersion predictions, however there is limited information regarding source term of it: liquid spill and vaporization. There is a need of further improvements on the understanding of these phenomena and the quantification of the most important parameters that can affect them. The vaporization of cryogenic liquids is governed by the heat transfer phenomena including conduction, convection and thermal radiation mechanisms. The present work investigates the contribution of each of these heat transfer modes to the vaporization rate of cryogenic liquid nitrogen (LN2) contained in a Dewar flask using well controlled and instrumented laboratory scale experiments. LN2 vaporization rate was measured with individually controllable contributions from convective (generated by an electric fan) and thermal radiative (generated by light bulb) heat transfer in the presence of a baseline conductive heat transfer rate. In both cases of convection and radiation analysis the experimental study showed that they can play a significant role in the vaporization rate of LN2. It was observed that the radiative heat absorbed by the LN2 during the vaporization experiment represents only 50{\%}–65{\%} of the incident radiation that would reach the LN2 pool surface if no vapour was present. Convective heat transfer generated by the fan was shown to have had the most significant contribution to the total heat transfer. As expected, this contribution was significantly higher than the one from bulb radiation. The experimental data also showed that the liquid level in the Dewar play a key role in the resulting amount of convective heat transfer. This could be attributed to the fact that lower liquid level the side walls of the Dewar were high enough to hold a layer of vapour and limit air motion directly above the liquid surface, thus limiting the heat transfer by convection.},

abstract = {Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) presents additional hazards compared with traditional marine fuels, such as oil and diesel. Hence, the safety risk is also different to that from traditional fuels. To ensure the safety of those onboard it is necessary to consider different and/or additional safeguards when using LNG. In the absence of prescriptive requirements, risk analysis techniques are being used to identify such safeguards. However, it is not always apparent if these safeguards address those areas that contribute most to the risk. To help with this, a risk assessment model has been developed. A critical step in this model is the determination of release likelihood and this provides guidance on the selection of appropriate safeguards in leak prevention. This paper summarises the release likelihood data used and provides an example of its use for a simplified LNG fuelling system.},

abstract = {The treatment of inlet conditions for LES is a complex problem, but of extreme importance as, in many cases, the fluid behaviour within the domain is determined in large part by the inlet behaviour. The reason why it is so difficult to formulate inlet conditions is because the inlet flow must include a stochastically-varying component: ideally this component should ‘look' like turbulence whilst at the same time be as simple as possible to implement and modify. We review methods for accomplishing this reported in the literature, these being ‘precursor simulation' methods and ‘synthesis' methods, and implement our own novel versions of these using the code OpenFOAM. Conclusions have been drawn about the relative merits of the different approaches, based on the physical realism of the results and the ease of construction and use.},

abstract = {Starting with simple definitions and the scope of micrometeorology and the atmospheric planetary boundary layer (PBL), the importance of small-scale turbulent exchange and energy dissipation processes in the PBL to the evolution of local weather and climate is pointed out. The energy budgets of an “ideal” surface and a near-surface canopy layer are briefly described and typical diurnal variations of measured energy fluxes at two (a rural and a suburban) sites are illustrated. Using the conservation equations of thermodynamic energy and moisture, temporal and spatial variations of mean air temperature and specific humidity are described. Diurnal evolutions of potential temperature profiles and the corresponding PBL height are illustrated with some observed data. Typical mean wind profiles in the daytime convective boundary layer (CBL) and the nighttime stable boundary layer (SBL) are also shown and discussed. The strong influence of stability on the PBL height and structure and their diurnal variations are discussed. The widely used flux-profile relations based on the Monin-Obukhov surface-layer similarity theory are presented with a brief discussion of parameterization of surface roughness and fluxes. The statistical description of the PBL turbulence and its commonly used quantitative measures are presented with an illustration of observed time series of turbulence. Some of the better-known similarity theories and scaling of turbulence in the PBL are described. Finally, different types of turbulence closure theories and numerical simulations/models of the PBL are briefly reviewed.},
