\begin{acknowledgements}      
Firstly, I would like to acknowledge my supervisor Associate Prof Ng Yin Kwee, Eddie for his guidance, encouragements and supports. I also want to express my sincere gratitude to my co-supervisor Associate Prof Dimitris Konovessis and Assistant Prof Martin Skotes for their insightful advices and supports during my PhD study.

I also would like to express my gratitude to Nanyang Technological University for providing me the NTU research scholarship. Without this opportunity and financial support, I can hardly pursue the journey of PhD.

Thank you all my friends here in NTU for their joyfulness and supports you bring to me. Finally, I would like to gratitude my family. Their kindness and encouragement motivate me for all my endeavours.
